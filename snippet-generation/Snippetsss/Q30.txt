consumer difficulties with computerized transactions an empirical investigation the prevalence with which errors may be encountered by the end targets of a computerized process is assessed how many and what type of errors occur how easily are they corrected what is the reaction of consumers to errors to a failure to correct them what can be learned by designers of large management packages from such data results show that with the present state of the art approximately 40 percent of individuals or households having average contacts with different types of accounts experience one or more errors per year eighty percent relate to billing attempts to correct errors often turned out to be difficult and not always successful there appears to be some conflict between computer using organizations and their public also the role of poor man agement packages including poor software is indicated while most management systems may be adequate results of the survey raise concerns about the timeliness and the number of designs of very large linked program packages as eft for instance cacm may 1979 sterling t errors systems errors billing errors management systems consumers 20 21 212 22 350 352 355 419 46 ca790503 dh june 5 1979 321 pm

intentional resolution of privacy protection in database systems traditionally privacy protection in database systems is understood to be the control over what information a given user can get from a database this paper is concerned with another independent dimension of privacy protection the control over what a user is allowed to do with a piece of information supplied to him by the database the ability to condition the supply of information on its intended use is called here intentional resolution of privacy protection the practical importance of intentional resolution is demonstrated by several examples and its realization is discussed it is shown that intentional resolution can be achieved but that it involves a radical change from the traditional approach to the process of user database interaction in particular it appears to be necessary for the database to impose a certain amount of control over the internal behavior of users programs which interact with it a model for user database interaction which admits such a control is developed cacm march 1976 minsky n protection in database protection in programming languages privacy security intentional resolution of privacy interaction with databases 350 370 420 430 ca760304 jb january 4 1978 444 pm

arguments for a moratorium on the construction of a community information utility in this article the author urges a prudent and decentralized approach to the question of the design and desirability of computerized community information utilities before accepting the inevitability and desirability of this or any technology we should 1 be sure of the feasibility internally and externally of what is proposed 2 project and perhaps wait for changes in complementary techniques 3 evaluate current and projected supplementary techniques 4 establish the existence of demand for what is proposed 5 take steps to involve a representative group of ultimate users in systems design and 6 carefully think through possible side effects on man and his world view current proposals for community information utilities are examined in this framework and the conclusion is drawn that society is not yet in a position to justify either the construction of an information utility in a prototype community or the acceptance of a policy in favor of its widespread implementation cacm december 1974 press l i community information utilities social implications public policy 21 23 ca741202 jb january 16 1978 1002 am

management utilization of computers in american local governments traditional concepts of management information systems mis bear little relation to the information systems currently in use by top management in most us local governments what exists is management oriented computing involving the use of relatively unsophisticated applications despite the unsophisticated nature of these systems management use of computing is surprisingly common but also varied in its extent among local governments management computing is most prevalent in those governments with professional management practices where top management is supportive of computing and tends to control computing decisions and where department users have less control over design and implementation activities finally management computing clearly has impacts for top managers mostly involving improvements in decision information cacm march 1978 dutton w kraemer k computer utilization management information system american local government city government computers county government computers computer impacts management computing 20 21 211 219 24 245 29 35 353 ca780302 jb march 28 1978 146 pm
