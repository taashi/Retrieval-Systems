on the relative efficiencies of context free grammar recognizers a number of diverse recognition procedures that have been proposed for parsing sentences with respect to a context free grammar are described in this paper by means of a common device each procedure is defined by giving an algorithm for obtaining a nondeterministic turing machine recognizer that is equivalent to a given context free grammar the formalization of the turing machine has been chosen to make possible particularly simple description of the parsing procedures considered an attempt has been made to compare recognition efficiencies for the procedures defined for a few simple grammars and sentences a formal comparison has been made empirical comparison of the recognition of more realistic programming languages such as lisp and algol has been made by means of a program which simulates the turing machine on the univac m 460 computer several algorithms for producing grammars equivalent to a given context free grammar have been considered and the increase in recognition efficiency they afford has been empirically investigated cacm may 1965 griffiths t v petrick s r ca650506 jb march 7 1978 238 pm

an efficient context free parsing algorithm a parsing algorithm which seems to be the most efficient general context free algorithm known is described it is similar to both knuths lrk algorithm and the familiar top down algorithm it has a time bound proportional to n3 where n is the length of the string being parsed in general it has a n2 bound for unambiguous grammars and it runs in linear time on a large class of grammars which seems to include most practical context free programming language grammars in an empirical comparison it appears to be superior to the top down and bottom up algorithms studied by griffiths and petrick cacm february 1970 earley j syntax analysis parsing context free grammar compilers computational complexity 412 522 523 ca700205 jb february 14 1978 1035 am

context sensitive parsing this paper presents a canonical form for context sensitive derivations and a parsing algorithm which finds each context sensitive analysis once and only once the amount of memory required by the algorithm is essentially no more than the required to store a single complete derivation in addition a modified version of the basic algorithm is presented which blocks infinite analyses for grammars which contain loops the algorithm is also compared with several previous parsers for context sensitive grammars and general rewriting systems and the difference between the two types of analyses is discussed the algorithm appears to be complementary to an algorithm by s kuno in several respects including the space time trade off and the degree of context dependence involved cacm july 1970 woods w a context sensitive grammars context sensitive parsing formal grammars formal language theory parsing parsing algorithms recognition algorithms 342 522 523 ca700707 jb february 10 1978 443 pm

syntax directed least errors analysis for context free languages a practical approach a least errors recognizer is developed informally using the well known recognizer of earley along with elements of bellmans dynamic programming the analyzer takes a general class of context free grammars as drivers and any finite string as input recognition consists of a least errors count for a corrected version of the input relative to the driver grammar the algorithm design emphasizes practical aspects which help in programming it cacm january 1974 lyon g arbitrary input strings context free grammars parsing dynamic programming stored subanalyses separability state merging least errors correction 412 523 542 ca740101 jb january 18 1978 257 pm

an algorithm for the construction of bounded context parsers an algorithm is described which accepts an arbitrary context free grammar and constructs a bounded context parser for it whenever such a parser exists in the first part of the paper the definition of a context free grammar and the working of a bounded context parser are recalled the notion of reduction class for a context free grammar is then introduced and its connection with the structure of a bounded context parser is indicated next pushdown automata which generate the different reduction classes of a context free grammar are defined finally the algorithm is described it essentially carries out an exhaustive study of all possible runs of the pushdown automata generating the reduction classes in the second part the utility of the algorithm is discuss ed in the light of the experience gained from its use in compiler design the algorithm is claimed to be particularly useful in the simultaneous design of a language and a compiler for it cacm may 1970 loeckx j bounded context parsing bounded context syntactic analysis parser construction syntactical analyzer construction generators compiler compilers compiler writing systems translator writing systems metacompilers context free grammars formal languages pushdown automata 412 522 523 ca700505 jb february 13 1978 158 pm

the restriction language for computer grammars of natural language over the past few years a number of systems for the computer analysis of natural language sentences have been based on augmented context free grammars a context free grammar which defines a set of parse trees for a sentence plus a group of restrictions to which a tree must conform in order to be a valid sentence analysis as the coverage of the grammar is increased an efficient representation becomes essential for further development this paper presents a programming language designed specifically for the compact and perspicuous statement of restrictions of a natural language grammar it is based on ten years experience parsing text sentences with the comprehensive english grammar of the n linguistic string project and embodies in its syntax and routines the relations which were found to be useful and adequate for computerized natural language analysis the language is used in the current implementation of the linguistic string parser cacm july 1975 sager n grishman r natural language parsing grammar programming languages 342 379 422 ca750703 jb january 9 1978 1017 am
