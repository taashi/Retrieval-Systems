an algorithm for the blocks and cutnodes of a graph an efficient method is presented for finding blocks and cutnodes of an arbitrary undirected graph the graph may be represented either i as an ordered list of edges or ii as a packed adjacency matrix if w denotes the word length of the machine employed the storage in machine words required for a graph with n nodes and m edges increases essentially as 2mn in case i or n2win case ii a spanning tree with labeled edges is grown two edges finally bearing different labels if and only if they belong to different blocks for both representations the time required to analyze a graph on n nodes increases as ng where g depends on the type of graph 1 g 2 and both bounds are attained values of g are derived for each of several suitable families of test graphs generated by an extension of the web grammar approach the algorithm is compared in detail with that proposed by read for which 1 g 3 cacm july 1971 paton k algorithm block block cutpoint tree cutnode fundamental cycle set graph lobe lobe decomposition graph separable spanning tree web grammar 532 ca710705 jb february 3 1978 858 am

new methods to color the vertices of a graph this paper describes efficient new heuristic methods to color the vertices of a graph which rely upon the comparison of the degrees and structure of a graph a method is developed which is exact for bipartite graphs and is an important part of heuristic procedures to find maximal cliques in general graphs finally an exact method is given which performs better than the randall brown algorithm and is able to color larger graphs and the new heuristic methods the classical methods and the exact method are compared cacm april 1979 brelaz d np complete graph structure balancing graph coloring scheduling comparison of the methods 525 532 ca790405 dh june 5 1979 205 pm

an implemented graph algorithm for winning shannon switching games in this tutorial paper a computer program which wins shannon switching games is described since these games are played on graphs the program is a good example of the implementation of graph algorithms the two players in a shannon switching game connect and cut have nonsimilar goals either connect cut or the player moving first is guaranteed the existence of a winning strategy the simple strategy explained in this paper is valid in all three cases in fact the major routines never need to know whether the computer is connect or cut cacm april 1972 chase s m graph algorithms graph processing shannon switching games game playing graph theory positional games demonstration programs game theory spinning trees 369 532 ca720405 jb january 31 1978 134 pm

efficient algorithms for graph manipulation h algorithm a447 efficient algorithms are presented for partitioning a graph into connected components biconnected components and simple paths the algorithm for partitioning of a graph into simple paths is iterative and each iteration produces a new path between two vertices already on paths the start vertex can be specified dynamically if v is the number of vertices and e is the number of edges each algorithm requires time and space proportional to max v e when executed on a random access computer cacm june 1973 hopcroft j tarjan r graphs analysis of algorithms graph manipulation 532 ca730610 jb january 23 1978 155 pm

cellular arrays for the solution of graph problems a cellular array is a two dimensional checkerboard type interconnection of identical modules or cells where each cell contains a few bits of memory and a small amount of combinational logic and communicates mainly with its immediate neighbors in the array the chief computational advantage offered by cellular arrays is the improvement in speed achieved by virtue of the possibilities for parallel processing in this paper it is shown that cellular arrays are inherently well suited for the solution of many graph problems for example the adjacency matrix of a graph is easily mapped onto an array each matrix element is stored in one cell of the array and typical row and column operations are readily implemented by simple cell logic a major challenge in the effective use of cellular arrays for the solution of graph problems is the determination of algorithms that exploit the possibilities for parallelism especially for problems whose solutions appear to be inherently serial in particular several parallelized algorithms are presented for the solution of certain spanning tree distance and path problems with direct applications to wire routing pert chart analysis and the analysis of many types of networks these algorithms exhibit a computation time that in many cases grows at a rate not exceeding log2 n where n is the number of nodes in the graph straightforward cellular implementations of the well known serial algorithms for these problems require about n steps and noncellular implementations require from n2 to n3 steps cacm september 1972 levitt k n kautz w h graph theory cellular logic in memory arrays parallel processing special purpose computers algorithms for distance and spanning tree problems 532 622 65 ca720901 jb january 30 1978 916 am
