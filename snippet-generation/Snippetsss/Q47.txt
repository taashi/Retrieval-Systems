experimental evaluation of information retrieval through a teletypewriter experiments designed to evaluate the capabilities of mechanized information retrieval systems with emphasis on interactive man machine language and on some of the mechanical and psychological limitations in their design were conducted at the moore school information systems laboratory the basic assumption of the research is that an information retrieval system that provides for man machine dialogue at a remote inquiry terminal should provide a searcher with many of the tools which would be available to him were he actually performing his search at a library or repository of documents factors involved in evaluation of such a system include ease of use learning time and effectiveness of actual retrieval three experiments and the conclusions resulting from them are detailed cacm september 1968 rubinoff m bergman s franks w rubinoff e information retrieval testing information system evaluation experimental document retrieval document retrieval document perusal man machine communication remote console communication teletypewriter communication remote terminal communication retrieval command language symbolic command language interactive systems user learning factors on line searching 372 374 379 381 ca680902 jb february 22 1978 930 am

file organization the consecutive retrieval property the consecutive retrieval property is an important relation between a query set and record set its existence enables the design of an information retrieval system with a minimal search time and no redundant storage some important theorems on the consecutive retrieval property are proved in this paper conditions under which the consecutive retrieval property exists and remain invariant have been established an outline for designing an information retrieval system based on the consecutive retrieval property is also discussed cacm september 1972 ghosh s p file organization consecutive storage consecutive retrieval information retrieval record organization query structure record structure storage on tapes storage space minimum access time 370 373 374 ca720902 jb january 27 1978 452 pm

the use of an interactive information storage and retrieval system in medical research this paper presents the results of a study of the use of an interactive computerized storage and retrieval system a monitor built into the computer system provided usage data for the study additional data on user reactions were gathe red from a questionnaire the results show the important role played by frequently chosen laboratory reference leaders in influencing the use of this system the implications of the study for the design of similar systems are discussed cacm march 1978 lucas hr implementation system use information storage and retrieval system 210 350 372 ca780301 jb march 28 1978 151 pm

effective information retrieval using term accuracy the performance of information retrieval systems can be evaluated in a number of different ways much of the published evaluation work is based on measuring the retrieval performance of an average user query unfortunately formal proofs are difficult to construct for the average case in the present study retrieval evaluation is based on optimizing the performance of a specific user query the concept of query term accuracy is in troduced as the probability of occurrence of a query term in the documents relevant to that query by relating term accuracy to the frequency of occurrence of the term in the documents of a collection it is possible to give formal proofs of the effectiveness with respect to a given user query of a number of automatic indexing systems that have been used successfully in experimental situations among these are inverse document frequency weighting thesaurus construction and phrase generation cacm march 1977 yu c t salton g information retrieval automatic indexing content analysis term accuracy frequency weighting thesaurus and phrase transformations 371 372 375 ca770302 jb december 30 1977 152 am
