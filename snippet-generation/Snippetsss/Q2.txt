analysis of the availability of computer systems using computer aided algebra analytical results related to the availability of a computer system constructed of unreliable processors are presented in this paper these results are obtained by using various computer aided algebraic manipulation techniques a major purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that the difficulties of obtaining analytical solutions to markov processes can be considerably reduced by the application of symbol manipulation programs since many physical systems can be modeled by markov and semi markov processes the potential range of application of these techniques is much wider than the problem of availability analyzed here cacm july 1978 chattergy r pooch u computer aided algebra symbol manipulation markov process reliability redundant structures on line computer system 382 55 57 81 83 ca780710 dh february 7 1979 337 pm

optimal storage allocation for serial files a computer system uses several serial files the files reside on a direct access storage device in which storage space is limited records are added to the files either by jobs in batch processing mode or by on line transactions each transaction or job generates a demand vector which designates the space required in each file for record addition whenever one file runs out of space the system must be reorganized this paper considers several criteria for best allocating storage space to the files cacm february 1979 mendelson h pliskin j yechiali u serial files storage allocation reorganization partitioned dataset 35 37 433 46 ca790208 dh april 12 1979 1034 am

an interactive display for approximation by linear programming an interactive program with a graphical display has been developed for the approximation of data by means of a linear combination of functions including splines selected by the user the coefficients of the approximation are determined by linear programming so as to minimize the error in either the l1 or l infinity norm auxiliary conditions such as monotonicity or convexity of the approximation can also be imposed this interactive system is described and several examples of its use are given cacm november 1970 lafata p rosen j b approximation data fitting functional approximation linear programming interactive graphical display spline functions 513 541 ca701101 jb february 10 1978 906 am

formal parsing systems automatic syntactic analysis has recently become important for both natural language data processing and syntax directed compilers a formal parsing system g v u t r consists of two finite disjoint vocabularies v and t a many many map u from v onto t and a recursive set r of strings in t called syntactic sentence classes every program for automatic syntactic analysis determines a formal parsing system a directed production analyzer i t x p is a nondeterministic pushdown store machine with internal vocabulary i input vocabulary t and all productions of p in the form z a ay1 ym where z yi are elements of the set i and a is an element of the set t every context free language can be analyzed by a directed production analyzer the kuno oettinger multiple path syntactic analyzer for english is a concrete example of a directed production analyzer and of a working parsing algorithm the connection between structures assigned by the analyzer and those of a conventional phrase structure grammar is examined in this paper cacm august 1964 greibach s a ca640818 jb march 9 1978 630 pm

manip a computer system for algebra and analytic differentiation a mathematical expression to be operated upon is written in fortran like notation and stored in the computer as a string of bcd characters with all blanks removed it may be as complicated as desired parentheses nested without restriction etc so long as the entire expression or any subsequent form does not exceed 5000 characters the problemm of performing algebraic operations and obtaining analytic derivatives was translated into that of identifying and manipulating character sequences programs which resulted were written in fortran iv for a cdc 3600 and are discussed in detail cacm august 1966 bender b ca660816 es march 17 1982 1010 am
