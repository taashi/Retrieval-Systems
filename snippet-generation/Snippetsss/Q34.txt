a stopping criterion for polynomial root finding when searching for the root of a polynomial it is generally difficult to know just when to accept a number as an adequate approximation to the root in this paper an algorithm is presented which allows one to terminate the iteration process on the basis of calculated bounds for the roundoff error which occurs in evaluating the polynomial this stopping criterion has been tested on numerous examples and has been found to serve as a satisfactory means for accepting a complex number as a zero of a real polynomial cacm october 1967 adams d a ca671009 jb february 27 1978 156 pm

an algorithm for generating root locus diagrams a technique for using a digital computer to draw both ordinary and time lag root locus diagrams is described ordinary diagrams are drawn much faster and more accurately than ever before time lag diagrams which had been impossible to obtain are drawn with the same speed and accuracy as ordinary diagrams cacm march 1967 krall a m fornaro r ca670313 jb february 28 1978 1257 pm

optimal starting approximations for generating square root for slow or no divide on machine with slow or no division it is preferable to use an iterative scheme for the square root different from the classical heron scheme the problem of optimal initial approximants is considered and some optimal polynomial initial approximations are tabulated cacm september 1970 wilson m w square root newton raphson iteration optimal approximants 513 ca700906 jb february 10 1978 133 pm

a note on range transformations for square root and logarithm there was the germ of an idea in two previous papers 1 2 which no one seems to have picked up in almost five years for certain functions it seems desirable to transform the argument to a short range symmetric about 101 will give examples of this usage for the square root and logarithm function for both binary and decimal machines cacm june 1963 bemer r w ca630601 jb march 14 1978 1041 am
