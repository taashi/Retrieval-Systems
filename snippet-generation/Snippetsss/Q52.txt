the digital simulation of river plankton population dynamics this paper deals with the development of a mathematical model for and the digital simulation in fortran iv of phytoplankton and zooplankton population densities in a river using previously developed rate expressions in order to study the relationships between the ecological mechanisms involved the simulation parameters were varied illustrating the response of the ecosystem to different conditions including those corresponding to certain types of chemical and thermal pollution as an investigation of the accuracy of the simulation methods a simulation of the actual population dynamics of asterionella in the columbia river was made based on approximations of conditions in that river although not totally accurate the simulation was found to predict the general annual pattern of plankton growth fairly well and specifically revealed the importance of the annual velocity cycle in determining such patterns in addition the study demonstrates the usefulness of digital simulations in the examinations of certain aquatic ecosystems as well as in environmental planning involving such examinations cacm september 1975 claudson r m digital simulation mathematical modeling plankton population dynamics phytoplankton zooplankton river ecosystems ecological mechanisms environmental simulation modeling ecosystems pollution environmental impact environmental planning 312 319 ca750903 jb january 6 1978 255 pm

significant event simulation this paper compares a new method of simulation organization called the significant event method with an old one called the clock pulse method using as examples two automobile traffic models the significant event method is found to be more efficient than the clock pulse method at low levels of system interaction and less efficient at high levels a simple mathematical model for the trade off in the relative running time of the two methods is developed the model aids in choosing between the two simulation methods for a particular experiment it is concluded that the significant event method can be of value in the simulation of some systems when computational efficiency is of sufficient importance cacm june 1975 babich a f grason j parnas d l simulation organization event simulation clock pulse simulation significant event simulation 81 ca750604 jb january 9 1978 120 pm

exclusive simulation of activity in digital networks a technique for simulating the detailed logic networks of large and active digital systems is described essential objectives sought are improved ease and economy in model generation economy in execution time and space and a facility for handling simultaneous activities the main results obtained are a clear and useful separation of structural and behavioral model description a reduction of manual tasks in converting boolean logic into a structural model the elimination of manual processes in achieving exclusive simulation of activity an event scheduling technique which does not deteriorate in economy as the event queue grows in length and a simulation procedure which deals effectively with any mixture of serial and simultaneous activities the passage of time is simulated in a precise quantitative fashion and systems to be simulated may be combinations of synchronous and asynchronous logic certain aspects of the techniques described may be used for the simulation of network structures other than digital networks cacm february 1969 ulrich e g simulation logical simulation digital simulation large systems simulation network structures scheduling queuing simultaneous activities parallel events 422 429 69 ca690210 jb february 20 1978 958 am

hybrid simulation models of computer systems this paper describes the structure and operation of a hybrid simulation model in which both discrete event simulation and analytic techniques are combined to produce efficient yet accurate system models in an example based on a simple hypothetical computer system discrete event simulation is used to model the arrival and activation of jobs and a central server queueing network models the use of system processors the accuracy and efficiency of the hybrid technique are demonstrated by comparing the result and computational costs of the hybrid model of the example with those of an equivalent simulation only model cacm september 1978 schwetman h performance evaluation simulation queueing network models central server model 432 435 81 ca780902 dh february 5 1979 332 pm

a comparison of simulation event list algorithms four algorithms are considered which can be used to schedule events in a general purpose discrete simulation system two of the algorithms are new one is based on an end order tree structure for event notices and another uses an indexed linear list the algorithms are tested with a set of typical stochastic scheduling distributions especially chosen to show the advantages and limitations of the algorithms the end order tree algorithm is shown to be an advantageous immediate replacement for the algorithm in use with current simulation languages the most promising algorithm uses the indexed list concept it will require an adaptive routine before it can be employed in general purpose simulators but its performance is such that further study would be fruitful cacm april 1975 vaucher j g duval p simulation time flow mechanisms event list algorithm simulation time flow mechanisms event list algorithm simulation executive event scheduling routine discrete system simulation sorting 374 422 81 ca750410 jb january 9 1978 343 pm

computer simulation discussion of the technique and comparison of languages the purpose of this paper is to present a comparison of some computer simulation languages and of some of the involved in comparing software packages for digital computers are discussed in part i the issue is obvious users of digital computers must choose from available languages or write their own substantial costs can occur particularly in training implementation and computer time if an inappropriate language is chosenore and more computer simulation languages are being developed comparisons and evaluations of existing languages are useful for designers and implementers as well as users the second part is devoted to computer simulation and simulation languages the computational characteristics of simulation are discussed with special attention being paid to a distinction between continuous and discrete change models part iii presents a detailed comparison of six simulation languages and packages simscript clp csl gasp cpss and sol the characteristics of each are summarized in a series of tables the implications of this analysis for designers of languages for users and for implementers are developed the conclusion of the paper is that the packages now available for computer simulation offer features which none of the more general purpose packages do and that analysis of strengths and weaknesses of each suggests ways in which both current and future simulation languages and packages can be improved cacm october 1966 teichroew d lubin j f ca661001 jb march 2 1978 423 pm

improved event scanning mechanisms for discrete event simulation simulation models of large complex real world applications have occasionally earned the reputation of eating up hours of computer time this problem may be attributed in part to difficulties such as slow stochastic convergence however an additional problem lies in the fact that a significant amount of bookkeeping time is required to keep future events in their proper sequence this paper presents a method for significantly reducing the time spent scanning future event lists in discrete event simulations there models are presented all of which improve in effectiveness as the events list scan problem becomes more burdensome cacm june 1975 wyman f p discrete event simulation simulation event scanning mechanisms 434 55 81 ca750611 jb january 9 1978 1243 pm
