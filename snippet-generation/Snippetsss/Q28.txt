reverse path forwarding of broadcast packets a broadcast packet is for delivery to all nodes of a network algorithms for accomplishing this delivery through a store and forward packet switching computer network include 1 transmission of separately addressed packets 2 multidestination addressing 3 hot potato forwarding 4 spanning tree forwarding and 5 source based forwarding to this list of algorithms we add 6 reverse path forwarding a broadcast routing method which exploits routing procedures and data structures already available for packet switching reverse path forwarding is a practical algorithm for broadcast routing in store and forward packet switching computer networks the algorithm is described as being practical because it is not optimal according to metrics developed for its analysis in this paper and also because it can be implemented in existing networks with less complexity than that required for the known alternatives cacm december 1978 dalal y metcalfe r reverse path forwarding broadcast packets routing computer networks store and forward packet switching broadcast protocols 381 432 532 ca781207 dh january 18 1979 310 pm

a correctness proof of a topology information main tenance protocol for a distributed computer network in order for the nodes of a distributed computer network to communicate each node must have information about the networks topology since nodes and links sometimes crash a scheme is needed to update this information one of the major constrain ts on such a topology information scheme is that it may not involve a central controller the topology information protocol that was implemented on the merit computer network is presented and explained this protocol is quite general and could be implemented on any computer network it is based on barans hot potato heuristic routing doctrine a correctness proof of this topology information protocol is also presented cacm july 1977 tajibnapis w d distributed computer network correctness proofs computer networks distributed control network topology routing problem in networks distributed operating system store and forward packet switching store and forward message switching traffic control 381 432 ca770703 jb december 28 1977 1159 am

ethernet distributed packet switching for local computer networks ethernet is a branching broadcast communication system for carrying digital data packets among locally distributed computing stations the packet transport mechanism provided by ethernet has been used to build systems which can be viewed as either local computer networks or loosely coupled multiprocessors an ethernets shared communication facility its ether is a passive broadcast medium with no central control coordination of access to the ether for packet broadcasts is distributed among the contending transmitting stations using controlled statistical arbitration switching of packets to their destinations on the ether is distributed among the receiving stations using packet address recognition design principles and implementation are described based on experience with an operating ethernet of 100 nodes along a kilometer of coaxial cable a model for estimating performance under heavy loads and a packet protocol for error controlled communication are included for completeness cacm july 1976 metcalfe r m boggs d r computer networks packet switching multiprocessing distributed control distributed computing broadcast communication statistical arbitration 381 432 635 ca760704 jb january 4 1978 1249 pm

a study of line overhead in the arpanet the form extent and effect of the communication line overhead in the arpanet are considered the source of this over head is separated into various levels of protocol hierarchy and the characteristics of each level are summarized then the line efficiency for various models of system use is studied some measurements of line efficiency for the arpanet are presented and by extrapolation these measurements are used to anticipate overhead in a heavily loaded network similar results are derived for a recently proposed network protocol and compared with those for the current system cacm january 1976 kleinrock l naylor w e opderbeck h arpanet computer communication networks interprocess communication measurement packet switching performance evaluation and efficiency resource sharing 381 439 46 49 ca760101 jb january 5 1978 1049 am

on quadratic adaptive routing algorithms two analytic models of a store and forward communications network are constructed one to find the optimal message routing and the other to illustrate the equilibrium stationary state maintained by an adaptive routing algorithm these models show that adaptive routing does not satisfy the necessary conditions for an optimal routing adaptive routing tends to overuse the direct path and underuse alternate routes because it does not consider the impact of its current routing decision on the future state of the network the form of the optimality conditions suggests that a modification of the adaptive algorithm will result in optimality the modification requires the substitution of a quadratic bias term instead of a linear one in the routing table maintained at each network node simulation results are presented which confirm the theoretical analysis for a simple network cacm january 1976 agnew c e routing algorithms adaptive routing quadratic routing alternate routing store and forward network distributed network computer network message switching 381 80 81 83 ca760103 jb january 5 1978 1037 am
