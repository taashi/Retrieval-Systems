order n correction for regular languages a method is presented for calculating a string b belonging to a given regular language l which is nearest in number of edit operations to a given input string a b is viewed as a reasonable correction for the possibly erroneous string a where a was originally intended to be a string of l the calculation of b by the method presented requires time proportional to a the number of characters in a the method should find applications in information retrieval artificial intelligence and spelling correction systems cacm may 1974 wagner r a error correction regular languages regular events finite state automata compiler error recovery spelling correction string best match problem correction corrector errors nondeterministic finite state automata 412 420 522 523 542 ca740503 jb january 17 1978 426 pm

regular right part grammars and their parsers this paper in troduces an alternative to context free grammars called regular right part rrp grammars which resemble pascal syntax diagrams formally rrp grammars have production right parts which are nondeterministic finite state machines fsms and as a special case regular expressions since these can be converted to fsms rrp grammars describe the syntax of programming languages more concisely and more understandably than is possible with cf grammars also in troduced is a class of parsers rrp lrm k parsers which includes the cf lrk parsers and provides the same advantages informally an rrp lrm k parser can determine the right end of each handle by considering at most k symbols to the right of the handle and the left end after the right end has been found by considering at most m symbols to the left of the handle a mechanism for determining the left end is required because there is no bound on the length of the handle cacm october 1977 lalonde w r finite state machines automata regular expressions syntax diagrams lrk grammars parser construction parsing programming languages language generation formal definition compilers translators scanners 42 521 523 ca771005 jb december 27 1977 1101 am

toward a general theory of special functions a list of a number of natural developments for the field of algebraic manipulation is given then the prospects for a general theory of functions defined by ordinary differential equations are discussed the claim is made that recent developments in mathematics indicate that it should be possible to algorithmically generate many properties of solutions to differential equations such a theory is preferable to a less general effort to make algebraic manipulation systems knowledgeable about the usual special functions eg exponential hypergeometric cacm july 1972 moses j algebraic manipulation special functions algebraic simplification symbolic integration algebraic geometry differential algebra 150 315 519 59 ca720705 jb january 30 1978 307 pm
