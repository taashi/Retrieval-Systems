a vector space model for automatic indexing in a document retrieval or other pattern matching environment where stored entities documents are compared with each other or with incoming patterns search requests it appears that the best indexing property space is one where each entity lies as far away from the others as possible in these circumstances the value of an indexing system may be expressible as a function of the density of the object space in particular retrieval performance may correlate inversely with space density an approach based on space density computations is used to choose an optimum indexing vocabulary for a collection of documents typical evaluation results are shown demonstrating the usefulness of the model cacm november 1975 salton g wong a yang c s automatic information retrieval automatic indexing content analysis document space 371 373 374 375 ca751101 jb january 6 1978 1014 am

effective information retrieval using term accuracy the performance of information retrieval systems can be evaluated in a number of different ways much of the published evaluation work is based on measuring the retrieval performance of an average user query unfortunately formal proofs are difficult to construct for the average case in the present study retrieval evaluation is based on optimizing the performance of a specific user query the concept of query term accuracy is in troduced as the probability of occurrence of a query term in the documents relevant to that query by relating term accuracy to the frequency of occurrence of the term in the documents of a collection it is possible to give formal proofs of the effectiveness with respect to a given user query of a number of automatic indexing systems that have been used successfully in experimental situations among these are inverse document frequency weighting thesaurus construction and phrase generation cacm march 1977 yu c t salton g information retrieval automatic indexing content analysis term accuracy frequency weighting thesaurus and phrase transformations 371 372 375 ca770302 jb december 30 1977 152 am

data manipulation and programming problems in automatic information retrieval automatic information retrieval programs require the manipulation of a variety of different data structures including linear text sparse matrices and tree or list structures the main data manipulations to be performed in automatic information systems are first briefly reviewed a variety of data representations which have been used to describe structured information are then examined and the characteristics of various processing languages are outlined in the light of the procedures requiring implementation advantages of these programming languages for the retrieval application are examined and suggestions are made for the design of programming facilities to aid in information retrieval cacm march 1966 salton g ca660315 jb march 3 1978 1135 am

theoretical considerations in information retrieval systems information storage and retrieval systems are composed of three major components a identification of information and tagging it for effective retrieval b searching strategy how to enter the file to circumvent the scanning of nonrelevant material and c file organization to make access to information efficient for identification of information the paper suggests that a metalanguage recently discussed in a paper by goffman verhoeff and belzer associated with an object language be used for searching strategy a linear model for an evaluation function of relevancy is developed which rewards the system for retrieving relevant documents and not retrieving the nonrelevant and penalizes the system for the escaped relevant documents and false drops the inadequacies of a linear model are indicated two approaches to file organization are discussed one is self organization of the file based on its history and past performance and the second is a self generating subset of the file with a high probability of being relevant cacm july 1964 belzer j goffman w ca640715 jb march 9 1978 755 pm

an information theoretic approach to text searching in direct access systems using direct access computer files of bibliographic information an attempt is made to overcome one of the problems often associated with information retrieval namely the maintenance and use of large dictionaries the greater part of which is used only infrequently a novel method is presented which maps the hyperbolic frequency distribution this is more suited to implementation on storage devices this method treats text as a string of characters rather than words bounded by spaces and chooses subsets of strings such that their frequencies of occurrence are more even than those of word types the members of this subset are then used as index keys for retrieval the rectangular distribution of key frequencies results in a much simplified file organization and promises considerable cost advantages cacm june 1974 barton i j creasey s e lynch m f snell m j text searching information theory file organization direct access information retrieval character string bit vector 342 370 373 374 56 ca740615 jb january 17 1978 207 pm

design of tree structures for efficient querying a standard information retrieval operation is to determine which records in a data collection satisfy a given query expressed in terms of data values the process of locating the desired responses can be represented by a tree search model this paper poses an optimization problem in the design of such trees to serve a well specified application the problem is academic in the sense that ordinarily the optimal tree cannot be implemented by means of practical techniques on the other hand it is potentially useful for the comparison it affords between observed performance and that of an intuitively attractive ideal search procedure as a practical application of such a model this paper considers the design of a novel tree search scheme based on a bit vector representation of data and shows that essentially the same algorithm can be used to design either an ideal search tree or a bit vector tree an experimental study of a small formatted file illustrates the concepts cacm september 1973 casey r g tree file information storage and retrieval clustering search data structure data management query answering 362 374 ca730904 jb january 23 1978 938 am

dynamic document processing the current role of computers in automatic document processing is briefly outlined and some reasons are given why the early promise of library automation and of the mechanization of documentation processes has not been fulfilled a new dynamic document environment is then outlined in which clustered files are searched and information is retrieved following an interactive user controlled search process methods are described for an automatic query modification based on user needs and for a continuous reorganization of the stored information as a function of earlier file processing and of normal collection growth the proposed procedures provide powerful tools for information retrieval and for the control of dynamic library collections in which new items are continually added and old ones are retired cacm july 1972 salton g automatic indexing automatic search and retrieval iterative searching mechanized library processing collection growth collection retirement feedback search 362 371 373 374 ca720721 jb january 30 1978 1059 am

a software design and evaluation system a critical failure of current software system design and implementation methodology is that the performance of a proposed design is not evaluated before it is actually implemented in this paper the reasons for this failure are explored and a new methodology which overcomes many of the difficulties is proposed a system which integrates performance evaluation with design and implementation is described this system is based on a simple high level language which is used to describe the evolving system at all stages of its development the source language description is used as direct input to performance analysis and simulation routines using the performance information obtained from these routines as feedback the problems which adversely affect performance are detected early enough so that they can be corrected without costly major reimplementation of the proposed system cacm february 1973 graham r m clancy g j jr devaney d b operating system development language processing software evaluation compilers system programming supervisory systems debugging program maintenance modeling system integration simulation 40 412 422 430 442 443 81 ca730206 jb january 24 1978 207 pm
