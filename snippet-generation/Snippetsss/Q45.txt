evaluation and selection of file organization a model and system this work first discusses the factors that affect file data base organization performance an elusive subject and then presents a methodology a model and a programmed system to estimate primarily total storage costs and average access time of several file organizations given a specific data base query characterization and device related specifications based on these estimates an appropriate file structure may be selected for the specific situation the system is a convenient tool to study file structures and to facilitate as much as possible the process of data base structure design and evaluation cacm september 1973 cardenas a f file organization file structures file management file organization performance file organization model file structure design secondary index organization simulation data base access time storage requirement data base analysis data management 370 371 372 374 379 40 ca730903 jb january 23 1978 946 am

analysis and performance of inverted data base structures the need to envision and architecture data base systems in a hierarchical level by level framework is stressed the inverted data base file organization is then analyzed considering implementation oriented aspects the inverted directory is viewed realistically as another large data base which itself is subjected to inversion formulations are derived to estimate average access time read only and storage requirements formalizing the interaction of data base content characteristics logical complexity of queries and machine timing and blocking specifications identified as having a first order effect on performance the formulations presented are necessary to be used in conjunction with any index selection criteria to determine the optimum set of index keys cacm may 1975 cardenas a f data base architecture inverted file organization data base performance and measurement secondary index organization information storage and retrieval query answering 370 371 372 374 379 40 ca750502 jb january 9 1978 315 pm

multi attribute retrieval with combined indexes in this paper a file organization scheme designed to replace the use of the popular secondary index filing scheme or inverted files on secondary key fields is described through the use of redundancy and storing keys or access numbers of the records that satisfy different combinations of secondary index values in buckets it is possible to retrieve all keys satisfying any input query derived from a subset of fields by a single access to an index file although each bucket may be used for many combinations of values and a combination of buckets may be required for a given query the method which in its degenerate case becomes the conventional secondary index filing scheme works similarly but has the following advantages 1 the elimination of multiple accesses in many cases 2 the elimination of false drops 3 the elimination of computer time to perform intersection of key sets each qualified for one secondary index field only and 4 the avoidance of long strings of keys when an index field appearing in a query has very few possible values redundancy in some cases is the same as the secondary indexing method in the general case trade off between the number of accesses for query and redundancy exists cacm november 1970 lum v y file organization secondary index files inverted files information retrieval data management access method secondary keys storage with buckets rapid retrieval balanced filing scheme elimination of false drops combining indexes query multi attribute retrieval 373 374 379 ca701102 jb february 10 1978 900 am

optimal reorganization of distributed space disk files in most database organizations the cost of accessing the database will increase due to structural changes caused by updates and insertions by reorganizing the database the access costs can be reduced a basic problem is to establish the proper tradeoff between performance storage costs and reorganization costs this paper considers the optimum points at which to reorganize a database a disk file organization which allows for distributed free space is described a cost function describing the excess costs due to physical disorganization is defined and this function is minimized to obtain the optimum reorganization points numerical examples based on the characteristics of existing disk storage devices are given cacm november 1976 maruyama k smith s e disk file free space retrieval insertion deterioration reorganization 370 373 ca761107 jb january 3 1978 259 pm

database abstractions aggregation aggregation is in troduced as an abstraction which is important in conceptualizing the real world aggregation transforms a relationship between objects into a higher level object a new data type called aggregation is developed which under certain criteria of well definedness specifies aggregation abstractions relational databases defined as collections of aggregates are structured as a hierarchy on n ary relations to main tain well definedness update operations on such databases must preserve two invariants well defined relations are distinct from relations in third normal form it is shown that these notions are complementary and both are important in database design a top down methodology for database design is described which separates decisions concerning aggregate structure from decisions concerning key identification it is suggested that aggregate types and other types which support real world abstractions without in troducing implementation detail should be incorporated into programming languages cacm june 1977 smith j m smith d c p data abstraction relational database data type aggregation database design data structure knowledge representation data definition language 365 369 379 429 433 434 ca770606 jb december 29 1977 1233 am
