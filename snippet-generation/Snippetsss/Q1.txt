operating system performance an overview of the current and future positions with respect to operating system performance is given while a great deal of information and a large number of models for subsystems have been developed gaps still exist in out knowledge because of the severe interactions between the various subsystems of an operating system an overall model of the total system must be developed to be able to analyze and design the performance aspects of an operating system although such total system designs are exceptional today it is projected that they will become increasingly more common and necessary in the near future such a design philosophy will clearly have a severe impact on the way we go about modularizing operating and computer systems cacm july 1972 lynch w c computer system operating system performance evaluation performance measurement measurement techniques modularity layering structured programming paging virtual memory inputoutput disk storage facility drum storage facility sector queueing 430 620 ca720709 jb january 30 1978 233 pm

some criteria for time sharing system performance time sharing systems as defined in this article are those multiaccess systems which permit a terminal user to utilize essentially the full resources of the system while sharing its time with other terminal users it is each terminal users ability to utilize the full resources of the system that makes quantitative evaluation of time sharing systems particularly difficult six criteria are described which have been successfully used to perform first level quantitative time sharing system performance evaluation cacm january 1969 stimler s time sharing performance criteria time sharing system operation time sharing performance analysis 240 430 432 620 ca690111 jb february 20 1978 1137 am

an analysis of some time sharing techniques the effectiveness of certain time sharing techniques such as program relocation disk rotational delay minimization and swap volume minimization is investigated summary data is presented and the findings are discussed the vehicle for this investigation was a simula based simulation model reflecting an early framework for a planned burroughs b6500 time sharing system inasmuch as the b6500 system is based upon the use of variable sized segments and a dynamic overlay procedure data is also presented which provides some indication of the effectiveness of this type of organization in a time sharing environment the design characteristics and operational capabilities of the simulation model are also described cacm february 1971 nielsen n r b6500 bulk core usage operating system model relocation rotational delay minimization simulation swap volume minimization system simulation time sharing 39 432 ca710203 jb february 8 1978 940 am

the design of the venus operating system the venus operating system is an experimental multiprogramming system which supports five or six concurrent users on a small computer the system was produced to test the effect of machine architecture on complexity of software the system is defined by a combination of microprograms and software the microprogram defines a machine with some unusual architectural feature the software exploits these features to define the operating system as simply as possible in this paper the development of the system is described with particular emphasis on the principles which guided the design cacm march 1972 liskov b h operating systems system design levels of abstraction machine architecture microprogramming segments semaphores multiprogramming virtual machines processes process communication virtual devices data sharing resource management deadlock 430 432 441 621 ca720302 jb january 31 1978 316 pm

interarrival statistics for time sharing systems the optimization of time shared system performance requires the description of the stochastic processes governing the user inputs and the program activity this paper provides a statistical description of the user input process in the sdc arpa general purpose time sharing system tss the input process is assumed to be stationary and to be defined by the interarrival time distribution the data obtained appear to justify satisfactorily the common assumption that the interarrival times are serially independent the data do not appear to justify except as a very rough approximation the usual assumption off an exponential distribution for interarrival time a much more satisfactory approximation to the data can be obtained with a biphase or triphase hyperexponential distribution cacm july 1966 coffman e g wood r c ca660704 jb march 2 1978 945 pm

performance monitoring in a time sharing system a software measurement facility which is part of a general purpose time sharing system is described the date collection facility dcf has been implemented in the michigan terminal system mts for the system360 model 67 it exists for the purpose of monitoring operating system and user program behavior and performance the overall structure of mts is outlined in order to explain the implementation of the dcf events in the system are identified and recorded from within the supervisor and dumped to magnetic tape by an auxiliary program for off line processing events in user programs which are unrelated to system actions are recorded with a supervisor call the time of occurrence of each event is accurately recorded and data items are further identified by job and type the overhead associated with data collection and its interference with normal jobs is carefully analyzed and both are shown to be minimal several examples are given of information obtained with the facility and of applications in which it has been useful some general guidelines are offered for the construction of future monitoring programs cacm november 1969 pinkerton t b performance monitoring performance measurement program behavior performance data multiprogramming performance software measurement time sharing performance system evaluation software monitor software instrumentation 431 432 439 442 443 ca691103 jb february 15 1978 107 pm

an experimental comparison of time sharing and batch processing the effectiveness for program development of the mit compatible time sharing system ctss was compared with that of the ibm ibsys batch processing system by means of a statistically designed experiment an identical set of four programming problems was assigned to each of a group of four programming subjects influences external to the systems such as the sequence of problem solution and programmer and problem characteristics were specified as design factors in the experiment data was obtained for six variables eg programmer time computer time elapsed time etc which were considered to be definitive of system effectiveness and analysis of variance techniques were employed to estimate system differences in these variables after differences due to the design factors had been eliminated statistical analysis of the experimental results provided strong evidence of important system differences as well as a critique of the experimental design itself with implications for further experimentation cacm may 1967 schatzoff m tsao r wiig r ca670501 jb february 28 1978 1109 am
