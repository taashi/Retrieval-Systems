texture and reflection in computer generated images in 1974 catmull developed a new algorithm for rendering images of bivariate surface patches this paper describes extensions of this algorithm in the areas of texture simulation and lighting models the parameterization of a patch defines a coordinate system which is used as a key for mapping patterns onto the surface the intensity of the pattern at each picture element is computed as a weighted average of regions of the pattern definition function the shape and size of this weighting function are chosen using digital signal processing theory the patch rendering algorithm allows accurate computation of the surface normal to the patch at each picture element permitting the simulation of the mirror reflections the amount of light coming from a given direction is modeled in a similar manner to the texture mapping and then added to the intensity obtained from the texture mapping several examples of images synthesized using these new techniques are included cacm october 1976 blinn j f newell m e computer graphics graphic display shading hidden surface removal 341 512 515 82 ca761002 jb january 4 1978 836 am

a region coloring technique for scene analysis a method of converting a picture into a cartoon or map whose regions correspond to differently textured regions is described texture edges in the picture are detected and solid regions surrounded by these usually broken edges are colored in using a propagation process the resulting map is cleaned by comparing the region colors with the textures of the corresponding regions in the picture and also by merging some regions with others according to criteria based on topology and size the method has been applied to the construction of cloud cover maps from cloud cover pictures obtained by satellites cacm april 1973 strong iii j p rosenfeld a picture processing scene analysis edge detection 363 82 ca730405 jb january 24 1978 948 am

computational aspects of multiple covariance analysis on a multifactor structure the computational procedure for the analysis of multiple covariance in statistics is discussed with reference to the analysis of variance a special operator calculus developed by hartly for programming analysis of variance for multifactor experiments is extended to cover the analysis of covariance this extension is accomplished by utilizing the connection between the analysis of covariance and the analysis of variance and by introducing a new operator the results are illustrated by a numerical example for analysis of covariance in which the basic computations are shown to be carried out by an analysis of variance program cacm july 1966 peng k c ca660708 jb march 2 1978 918 pm

a computer generated aid for cluster analysis a computer generated graphic method which can be used in conjunction with any hierarchical scheme of cluster analysis is described and illustrated the graphic principle used is the representation of the elements of a data matrix of similarities or dissimilarities by computer printed symbols of character overstrikes of various shades of darkness where a dark symbol corresponds to a small dissimilarity the plots applied to a data matrix before clustering and to the rearranged matrix after clustering show at a glance whether clustering brought forth any distinctive clusters a well known set of data consisting of the correlations of 24 psychological tests is used to illustrate the comparison of groupings by four methods of factor analysis and two methods of cluster analysis cacm june 1973 ling r f computer graphics cluster analysis numerical taxonomy hierarchical clustering factor analysis 310 330 336 449 ca730606 jb january 23 1978 220 pm

a fast fourier transform algorithm for real valued series a new procedure is presented for calculating the complex discrete fourier transform of real valued time series this procedure is described for an example where the number of points in the series is an integral power of two this algorithm preserves the order and symmetry of the cooley turkey fast fourier transform algorithm while effecting the two to one reduction in computation and storage which can be achieved when the series is real also discussed are hardware and software implementations of the algorithm which perform only n4 log2 n2 complex multiply and add operations and which require only n real storage locations in analyzing each n point record cacm october 1968 bergland g d fast fourier transform time series analysis digital filtering spectral analysis real time spectrum analyzers fourier analysis discrete fourier transform digital spectrum analysis fourier analysis algorithm fourier synthesis algorithm 380 381 49 549 622 ca681008 jb february 21 1978 323 pm
