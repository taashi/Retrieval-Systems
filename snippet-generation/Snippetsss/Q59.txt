do it by the numbers digital shorthand present communications systems transmit single characters in groups of coded pulses between simple terminal equipments since english words form only a sparse set of all possible alphabetic combinations present methods are inefficient when computer systems are substituted for these terminals using numeric representations of entire words or common phrases rather than character by character representations requires approximately one third of present transmission time this saving is reflected in overall costs other benefits accrue in code and language translation schemes provision is made for transmission of purely numeric andor binary streams and for single character transmission of non dictionary words such as the names of people or places cacm october 1960 bemer r w ca601004 jb march 20 1978 827 pm

storage and search properties of a tree organized memory system a memory with list properties 1 may be used to construct numeric alphabetic or alphanumeric trees such trees have information storage and retrieval properties applicable to problems involving large quantities of data or to problems where the quantity word length and distribution of stored information is not known a priori or changes rapidly during the processing the purpose of this paper is to examine the storage and search properties of a tree organized storage system assuming that a memory possessing certain list properties is available of prime interest is the application where a symbol table dictionary or similar file is to be stored and searched cacm january 1963 scidmore a k weinberg b l ca630104 jb march 14 1978 302 pm

a technique for computer detection and correction of spelling errors the method described assumes that a word which cannot be found in a dictionary has at most one error which might be a wrong missing or extra letter or a single transposition the unidentified input word is compared to the dictionary again testing each time to see if the words match assuming one of these errors occurred during a test run on garbled text correct identifications were made for over 95 percent of these error types cacm march 1964 damerau f j ca640320 jb march 10 1978 221 am

spline function methods for nonlinear boundary value problems the solution of the nonlinear differential equation yfx y y with two point boundary conditions is approximated by a quintic or cubic spline function yx the method is well suited to nonuniform mesh size and dynamic mesh size allocation for uniform mesh size h the error in the quintic spline yx is oh4 with typical error one third that from numerovs method requiring the differential equation to be satisfied at the mesh points results in a set of difference equations which are block tridiagonal and so are easily solved by relaxation or other standard methods cacm june 1969 blue j l boundary value problems differential equations finite differences functional approximation iterative methods nonlinear equations spline functions 513 515 517 ca690605 jb february 17 1978 1107 am

peekabit computer offspring of punched card peekaboo for natural language searching the peekaboo idea from punched card information retrieval methods has been mated with the idea of superimposed punching to produce a programming technique which cuts computer run time in half on a test search of 33 000 subject index entries a search program using the device has been operational since late 1963 as an item is entered in the store an 18 byte mask is created from the items meaningful words using the inclusive or operation if at search time the logical product using the and operation of this mask and a similarly constructed question mask is not equal to the question mask then one or more question words are not present in the store item an equality is in conclusive the words of the store item must be unpacked and compared with question words the present store is made up of over 600 000 subject index entries estimated to average 60 characters each longer texts such as abstracts could be handled by multiple masks cacm september 1968 hutton f c peekaboo superimposed coding natural language searching text searching information compaction computer search technique 374 ca680901 jb february 22 1978 938 am

multilevel operating systems the basic software for all newer computers is built on the well established need for standard operating systems this implies that all applications no matter how large complex or time consuming must operate under or more precisely on top of the standard system large applications require supervisory monitors which handle problems similar to those of the operating systems but at a different level sometimes still a third or even a fourth such level is required or desirable this leads naturally to the concept of multilevel systems similar vertically but different horizontally proper division of responsibility between levels leads to greater efficiency and less logical complexity while actually enhancing capability cacm march 1966 orchard hays w ca660310 jb march 3 1978 131 pm

programming decision tables in fortran cobol or algol a simple broad based approach for programming decision tables in fortran or cobol is developed and presented with inputs in standard form as defined in the paper the programming of any decision table can be done with one or two fortran statements or with two cobol statements if the compute verb is available in the cobol processor it is shown that the method is applicable even when there are more than two mutually exclusive states of one two or more table conditions it is further shown that multi state conditions in decision tables can often simplify the programming the method outlined has the further advantage that all possible combinations of conditions are considered it is shown that the suggested procedure is easily implemented in algol cacm january 1966 veinott c g ca660107 jb march 3 1978 408 pm
