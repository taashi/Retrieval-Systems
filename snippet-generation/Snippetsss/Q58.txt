a modification of efroymsons technique for stepwise regression analysis the computational technique conventionally used for stepwise multiple linear regression requires the storage of an n x n matrix of data when the number of variables n is large this requirement taxes the storage capacity of presently used machinery the near symmetry of the matrices involved permits a modification requiring only half the storage and computations of the conventional algorithm and this additional storage allows the analysis of problems containing more variables alternatively it permits the analysis of problems containing the same number of variables but with all computations performed in double precision cacm august 1968 breaux h j multiple linear regression statistical recurrence formulas correlation linear statistical models statistical computer programs curve fitting 40 440 50 55 510 513 ca680805 jb february 22 1978 1052 am

a comparison of the correlational behavior of random number generators for the ibm 360 hutchinson states that the new prime modulo multiplicative congruential pseudorandom generator attributed to d h lehmer has passed the usual statistical tests for random number generators it is here empirically shown that generators of this type can produce sequences whose autocorrelation functions up to lag 50 exhibit evidence of nonrandomness for many multiplicative constants an alternative generator proposed by tausworthe which uses irreducible polynomials over the field of characteristic two is shown to be free from this defect the applicability of these two generators to the ibm 360 is then discussed since computer word size can affect a generators statistical behavior the older mixed and simple congruential generators although extensively tested on computers having 36 or more bits per word may not be optimum generators for the ibm 360 cacm september 1968 whittlesey j r random numbers pseudorandom number generators autocorrelation function serial correlation digital shift register generators linear recurrence modulo two irreducible polynomials primitive trinomials modulo two congruential generators prime numbers statistical tests for randomness ibm 360 32 bit versus 36 bit word size 55 ca680910 jb february 21 1978 444 pm

tests of probabilistic models for propagation of roundoff errors in any prolonged computation it is generally assumed that the accumulated effect of roundoff errors is in some sense statistical the purpose of this paper is to give precise descriptions of certain probabilistic models for roundoff error and then to describe a series of experiments for testing the validity of these models it is concluded that the models are in general very good discrepancies are both rare and mild the test techniques can also be used to experiment with various types of special arithmetic cacm february 1966 hull t e swenson j r ca660210 jb march 3 1978 237 pm

ethernet distributed packet switching for local computer networks ethernet is a branching broadcast communication system for carrying digital data packets among locally distributed computing stations the packet transport mechanism provided by ethernet has been used to build systems which can be viewed as either local computer networks or loosely coupled multiprocessors an ethernets shared communication facility its ether is a passive broadcast medium with no central control coordination of access to the ether for packet broadcasts is distributed among the contending transmitting stations using controlled statistical arbitration switching of packets to their destinations on the ether is distributed among the receiving stations using packet address recognition design principles and implementation are described based on experience with an operating ethernet of 100 nodes along a kilometer of coaxial cable a model for estimating performance under heavy loads and a packet protocol for error controlled communication are included for completeness cacm july 1976 metcalfe r m boggs d r computer networks packet switching multiprocessing distributed control distributed computing broadcast communication statistical arbitration 381 432 635 ca760704 jb january 4 1978 1249 pm

a mathematical programming updating method using modified givens transformations and applied to lp problems an efficient and numerically stable method is presented for the problem of updating an orthogonal decomposition of a matrix of column or row vectors the fundamental idea is to add a column or row analogous to adding an additional row of data in a linear least squares problem a column or row is dropped by a formal scaling with the imaginary unit 1 followed by least squares addition of the column or row the elimination process for the procedure is successive ssive application of the givens transformation in modified more efficient form these ideas are illustrated with an implementation of the revised simplex method the algorithm is a general purpose one that does not account for any particular structure or sparsity in the equations some suggested computational tests for determining signs of various controlling parameters in the revised simplex algorithm are mentioned a simple means of constructing test cases and some sample computing times are presented cacm april 1979 hanson r wisniewski j linear programming numerical linear algebra modified givens transformations linear programming test cases 5 54 541 51 514 ca790404 dh may 21 1979 206 pm

a statistical model for console behavior in multiuser computers the ability of a computer system to communicate with the outside world efficiently is as important as its ability to perform computations efficiently it is quite difficult to characterize a particular user but rather easy to characterize the entire user community based on the properties of this community we have postulated a hypothetical virtual console no claim is made that a virtual console behaves like any actual console but the entire collection of virtual consoles models the collection of actual consoles using the model we answer questions like how many processes are suspended waiting for console input what is the maximum rate at which a process can execute what bounds can be set on overall buffer requirements answers to these and similar questions are needed in certain aspects of operating system design cacm september 1968 denning p j statistical models for input output operating system design input output design 430 441 55 ca680903 jb february 22 1978 921 am

problems in the statistical analysis of simulation experiments the comparison of means and the length of sample records research is continued into statistical analysis of simulation experiments containing autocorrelated time series it is shown how to estimate the lengths of sample records needed to use certain large sample results in measuring stability analogies between autocorrelated data and independent observations are described a way to test the difference of the mean of two experiments is suggested it is shown how the variance of the sample mean relates to the spectrum of the generating process and estimation of the quantities of interest is described the results expand the possibilities of statistical spectral analysis as applied to simulation experiments cacm february 1967 fishman g s ca670205 jb february 28 1978 334 pm
