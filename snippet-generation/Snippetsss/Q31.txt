using synthetic images to register real images with surface models a number of image analysis tasks can benefit from registration of the image with a model of the surface being imaged automatic navigation using visible light or radar images requires exact alignment of such images with digital terrain models in addition automatic classification of terrain using satellite imagery requires such alignment to deal correctly with the effects of varying sun angle and surface slope even inspection techniques for certain industrial parts may be improved by this means we achieve the required alignment by matching the real image with a synthetic image obtained from a surface model and known positions of the light sources the synthetic image intensity is calculated using the reflectance map a convenient way of describing surface reflection as a function of surface gradient we illustrate the technique using landsat images and digital terrain models cacm november 1978 horn b bachman b image registration synthetic images surface models automatic hill shading digital terrain models image transformation image matching shaded images 363 311 314 82 383 ca781104 dh january 26 1979 1116 am

reconstruction of pictures from their projections there are situations in the natural sciences and medicine eg in electron microscopy and x ray photography in which it is desirable to estimate the gray levels of a digital picture at the individual points from the sums of the gray levels along straight lines projections at a few angles usually in such situations the picture is far from determined and the problem is to find the most representative picture three algorithms are described all using monte carlo methods which were designed to solve this problem the algorithms are applicable in a large and varied number of fields the most important uses may be the reconstruction of possibly asymmetric particles from electron micrographs and three dimensional x ray analysis cacm december 1971 gordon r herman g t approximation biomedical image processing efficient encoding image processing linear programming mathematical programming monte carlo techniques optimization picture compression picture description picture processing stereology x ray analysis 312 313 315 317 363 541 56 ca711201 jb february 2 1978 1032 am

use of decision tables in computer programming a decision table is a tabular form for displaying decision logic decision tables have many inherent advantages the technique to be illustrated puts these advantages to use in that it enables one to program directly from a decision table the technique is based on the creation of a binary image of a limited entry decision table in computer memory a binary image of a given set of input conditions can also be created this data image is used to scan the decision table image to arrive at the proper course of action there are several advantages gained from the programming point view 1 amount of computer memory used is drastically reduced 2 programming is simplified and 3 documentation is brief and clear cacm january 1965 kirk h w ca650110 jb march 8 1978 236 pm

thinning algorithms on rectangular hexagonal and triangular arrays in this report three thinning algorithms are developed one each for use with rectangular hexagonal and triangular arrays the approach to the development of each algorithm is the same pictorial results produced by each of the algorithms are presented and the relative performances of the algorithms are compared it is found that the algorithm operating with the triangular array is the most sensitive to image irregularities and noise yet it will yield a thinned image with an overall reduced number of points it is concluded that the algorithm operating in conjunction with the hexagonal array has features which strike a balance between those of the other two arrays cacm september 1972 deutsch e s thinning algorithms rectangular hexagonal triangular arrays image processing skeleton 364 ca720907 jb january 27 1978 425 pm

some new methods of detecting step edges in digital pictures this note describes two operators that respond to step edges but not to ramps the first is similar to the digital laplacian but uses the max rather than the sum of the x and y second differences the second uses the difference between the mean and median gray levels in a neighborhood the outputs obtained from these operators applied to a set of test pictures are compared with each other and with the standard digital laplacian and gradient a third operator which uses the distance between the center and centroid of a neighborhood as an edge value is also briefly considered it turns out to be equivalent to one of the standard digital approximations to the gradient cacm february 1978 schachter b rosenfeld a image processing pattern recognition edge detection 363 ca780210 jb march 28 1978 156 pm
