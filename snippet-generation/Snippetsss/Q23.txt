high level programming for distributed computing programming for distributed and other loosely coupled systems is a problem of growing interest this paper describes an approach to distributed computing at the level of general purpose programming languages based on primitive notions of module message and transaction key the methodology is shown to be independent of particular languages and machines it appears to be useful for programming a wide range of tasks this is part of an ambitious program of development in advanced programming languages and relations with other aspects of the project are also discussed cacm june 1979 feldman j distributed computing modules messages assertions 422 432 ca790604 dh august 21 1979 431 pm

ethernet distributed packet switching for local computer networks ethernet is a branching broadcast communication system for carrying digital data packets among locally distributed computing stations the packet transport mechanism provided by ethernet has been used to build systems which can be viewed as either local computer networks or loosely coupled multiprocessors an ethernets shared communication facility its ether is a passive broadcast medium with no central control coordination of access to the ether for packet broadcasts is distributed among the contending transmitting stations using controlled statistical arbitration switching of packets to their destinations on the ether is distributed among the receiving stations using packet address recognition design principles and implementation are described based on experience with an operating ethernet of 100 nodes along a kilometer of coaxial cable a model for estimating performance under heavy loads and a packet protocol for error controlled communication are included for completeness cacm july 1976 metcalfe r m boggs d r computer networks packet switching multiprocessing distributed control distributed computing broadcast communication statistical arbitration 381 432 635 ca760704 jb january 4 1978 1249 pm

computer methods for sampling from the exponential and normal distributions various methods are known for transforming uniformly distributed random numbers into exponentially and normally distributed quantities the most efficient ones are compared in terms of memory requirements and speed with some new algorithms a number of procedures convert taylor series expansions directly into sampling steps an approach which may be used for sampling from any continuous distribution for the exponential distribution a definite recommendation can be made whereas in the case of the normal distribution there remains a choice between slower and shorter algorithms and faster but space consuming methods cacm october 1972 ahrens j h dieter u random numbers pseudorandom normal distribution exponential distribution exponential distribution simulation numerical analysis 329 357 511 55 ca721002 jb january 27 1978 355 pm

a position paper on computing and communications the effective operation of free enterprise in creating the envisioned information service industry is dependent upon three accomplishments 1 the restructuring of our information processing industry so that a clear division of costs is made among computing communications and the development of information services 2 the wide use of multiaccess system concepts so that information services may share in the use of computer installations and so that the cost of their construction is reasonable and 3 the development of public message switched communications services so that adequate provisions are made for information security cacm may 1968 dennis j b information networks information systems computing and free enterprise computing economics computer installation management government regulation communications services distributed data base program leasing 23 240 380 430 ca680511 jb february 23 1978 849 am

a data definition and mapping language a data definition language i sa declarative computer language for specifying data structures most data definition languages concentrate on the declaration of logical data structures with little concern for how these structures are physically realized on a computer system however the need for data definition languages which describe both the logical and physical aspects of data is increasingly apparent such languages will be a key systems as well as in advanced data management systems and distributed data bases this paper reviews past work in the data definition language for describing both logical and physical aspects of data applications of these generalized data definition languages are also discussed cacm december 1973 sibley e h taylor r w data definition language data and storage structure data translation data base management systems file translation 351 370 373 429 482 ca731202 jb january 19 1978 258 pm

time clocks and the ordering of events in a distributed system the concept of one event happening before another in a distributed system is examined and is shown to define a partial ordering of the events a distributed algorithm is given for synchronizing a system of logical clocks which can be used to totally order the events the use of the total ordering is illustrated with a method for solving synchronization problems the algorithm is then specialized for synchronizing physical clocks and a bound is derived on how far out of synchrony the clocks can become cacm july 1978 lamport l distributed systems computer networks clock synchronization multiprocess systems 432 529 ca780706 dh february 7 1979 430 pm
