an efficient search algorithm to find the elementary circuits of a graph a theoretically most efficient search algorithm is presented which uses an exhaustive search to find all of the elementary circuits of a graph the algorithm can be easily modified to find all of the elementary circuits with a particular attribute such as length a rigorous proof of the algorithm is given as well as an example of its application empirical bounds are presented relating the speed of the algorithm to the number of vertices and the number of arcs the speed is also related to the number of circuits in the graph to give a relation between speed and complexity extensions to undirected and s graphs are discussed cacm december 1970 tiernan j c algorithm graph theory circuit search algorithm path search algorithm searching 374 532 ca701202 jb february 9 1978 412 pm

logic structure tables logic tables are an excellent way of developing and expressing the logic required in procedures operations systems and circuits a set of rules for writing and using logic tables is explained by means of some simple examples then the logic structure of a vending machine is given in which two logic tables are used logic tables are two dimensional in nature enabling us to fully express and consider both the sequential and parallel aspects of logic they can be compiled directly into a computer program and so eliminate the need for flow charting and hand coding cacm june 1961 cantrell h n king j king f e h ca610605 jb march 16 1978 1040 pm

on the complexity of lrk testing the problem of determining whether an arbitrary context free grammar is a member of some easily parsed subclass of grammars such as the lrk grammars is considered the time complexity of this problem is analyzed both when k is considered to be a fixed integer and when k is considered to be a parameter of the test in the first case it is shown that for every k there exists an onk2 algorithm for testing the lrk property where n is the size of the grammar in question on the other hand if both k and the subject grammar are problem parameters then the complexity of the problem depends very strongly on the representation chosen for k more specifically it is shown that this problem is np complete when k is expressed in unary when k is expressed in binary the problem is complete for nondeterministic exponential time these results carry over to many other parameterized classes of grammars such as the llk strong llk slrk lck and strong lck grammars cacm december 1975 hunt h b iii szymanski t g ullman j d computational complexity context free grammars parsing lrk grammars np complete problems 412 523 525 ca751205 jb january 5 1978 428 pm

optimal balancing of io requests to disks determining a policy for efficient allocation and utilization of a set of disk drives with differing operational characteristics is examined using analytical techniques using standard queueing theory each disk drive is characterized by a queueing model with service time of a disk drive represented by the probability density function of the sum of two uniform distributions total response time of the set of disk models is then minimized under varying load conditions the results indicate that faster devices should have higher utilization factors and that the number of different device types utilized tends to decrease with decreasing load specific examples using 2314 and 3330 combinations are examined cacm september 1975 piepmeier w f disk drive hierarchies system evaluation inputoutput modeling queueing theory balancing scheduling device assignment 244 435 515 55 635 81 83 ca750904 jb january 6 1978 242 pm

some new upper bounds on the generation of prime numbers given an integer n what is the computational complexity of finding all the primes less than n a modified sieve of eratosthenes using doubly linked lists yields an algorithm of on arithmetic complexity this upper bound is shown to be equivalent to the theoretical lower bound for sieve methods without preprocessing use of preprocessing techniques involving space time and additive multiplicative tradeoffs reduces this upper bound to onlog logn and the bit complexity to on logn log log logn a storage requirement is described using on lognlog logn bits as well cacm september 1977 mairson h g computational complexity sieve prime number generation number theory linked list preprocessing balancing 525 539 ca770907 jb december 27 1977 1255 pm
