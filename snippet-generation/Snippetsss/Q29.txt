coding the lehmer pseudo random number generator an algorithm and coding technique is presented for quick evaluation of the lehmer pseudo random number generator modulo 231 1 a prime mersenne number with produces 231 2 numbers on a p bit greater than 31 computer the computation method is extendible to limited problems in modular arithmetic prime factorization for 261 2 and a primitive root for 261 1 the next largest prime mersenne number are given for possible construction of a pseudo random number generator of increased cycle length cacm february 1969 payne w h rabung j r bogyo t p pseudo random number random number modular arithmetic uniform probability density uniform frequency function simulation prime factorization primitive roots ca690205 jb february 20 1978 1107 am

a theorem proving language for experimentation because of the large number of strategies and inference rules presently under consideration in automated theorem proving there is a need for developing a language especially oriented toward automated theorem proving this paper discusses some of the features and instructions of this language the use of this language permits easy extension of automated theorem proving programs to include new strategies andor new inference rules such extend ability will permit general experimentation with the various alternative systems cacm june 1974 henschen l overbeek r wos l theorem proving resolution factoring paramodulation programming languages 360 422 521 ca740602 jb january 17 1978 337 pm
