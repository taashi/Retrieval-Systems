a vector space model for automatic indexing in a document retrieval or other pattern matching environment where stored entities documents are compared with each other or with incoming patterns search requests it appears that the best indexing property space is one where each entity lies as far away from the others as possible in these circumstances the value of an indexing system may be expressible as a function of the density of the object space in particular retrieval performance may correlate inversely with space density an approach based on space density computations is used to choose an optimum indexing vocabulary for a collection of documents typical evaluation results are shown demonstrating the usefulness of the model cacm november 1975 salton g wong a yang c s automatic information retrieval automatic indexing content analysis document space 371 373 374 375 ca751101 jb january 6 1978 1014 am

dynamic document processing the current role of computers in automatic document processing is briefly outlined and some reasons are given why the early promise of library automation and of the mechanization of documentation processes has not been fulfilled a new dynamic document environment is then outlined in which clustered files are searched and information is retrieved following an interactive user controlled search process methods are described for an automatic query modification based on user needs and for a continuous reorganization of the stored information as a function of earlier file processing and of normal collection growth the proposed procedures provide powerful tools for information retrieval and for the control of dynamic library collections in which new items are continually added and old ones are retired cacm july 1972 salton g automatic indexing automatic search and retrieval iterative searching mechanized library processing collection growth collection retirement feedback search 362 371 373 374 ca720721 jb january 30 1978 1059 am

data manipulation and programming problems in automatic information retrieval automatic information retrieval programs require the manipulation of a variety of different data structures including linear text sparse matrices and tree or list structures the main data manipulations to be performed in automatic information systems are first briefly reviewed a variety of data representations which have been used to describe structured information are then examined and the characteristics of various processing languages are outlined in the light of the procedures requiring implementation advantages of these programming languages for the retrieval application are examined and suggestions are made for the design of programming facilities to aid in information retrieval cacm march 1966 salton g ca660315 jb march 3 1978 1135 am

the smart automatic document retrieval system an illustration a fully automatic document retrieval system operating on the ibm 7094 is described the system is characterized by the fact that several hundred different methods are available to analyze documents and search requests this feature is used in the retrieval process by leaving the exact sequence of operations initially unspecified and adapting the search strategy to the needs of individual users the system is used not only to simulate an actual operating environment but also to test the effectiveness of the various available processing methods results obtained so far seem to indicate that some combination of analysis procedures can in general be relied upon to retrieve the wanted information a typical search request is used as an example in the present report to illustrate systems operations and evaluation procedures cacm june 1965 salton g lesk m e ca650619 jb march 6 1978 941 pm

optimal storage allocation for serial files a computer system uses several serial files the files reside on a direct access storage device in which storage space is limited records are added to the files either by jobs in batch processing mode or by on line transactions each transaction or job generates a demand vector which designates the space required in each file for record addition whenever one file runs out of space the system must be reorganized this paper considers several criteria for best allocating storage space to the files cacm february 1979 mendelson h pliskin j yechiali u serial files storage allocation reorganization partitioned dataset 35 37 433 46 ca790208 dh april 12 1979 1034 am

design of tree structures for efficient querying a standard information retrieval operation is to determine which records in a data collection satisfy a given query expressed in terms of data values the process of locating the desired responses can be represented by a tree search model this paper poses an optimization problem in the design of such trees to serve a well specified application the problem is academic in the sense that ordinarily the optimal tree cannot be implemented by means of practical techniques on the other hand it is potentially useful for the comparison it affords between observed performance and that of an intuitively attractive ideal search procedure as a practical application of such a model this paper considers the design of a novel tree search scheme based on a bit vector representation of data and shows that essentially the same algorithm can be used to design either an ideal search tree or a bit vector tree an experimental study of a small formatted file illustrates the concepts cacm september 1973 casey r g tree file information storage and retrieval clustering search data structure data management query answering 362 374 ca730904 jb january 23 1978 938 am

effective information retrieval using term accuracy the performance of information retrieval systems can be evaluated in a number of different ways much of the published evaluation work is based on measuring the retrieval performance of an average user query unfortunately formal proofs are difficult to construct for the average case in the present study retrieval evaluation is based on optimizing the performance of a specific user query the concept of query term accuracy is in troduced as the probability of occurrence of a query term in the documents relevant to that query by relating term accuracy to the frequency of occurrence of the term in the documents of a collection it is possible to give formal proofs of the effectiveness with respect to a given user query of a number of automatic indexing systems that have been used successfully in experimental situations among these are inverse document frequency weighting thesaurus construction and phrase generation cacm march 1977 yu c t salton g information retrieval automatic indexing content analysis term accuracy frequency weighting thesaurus and phrase transformations 371 372 375 ca770302 jb december 30 1977 152 am
