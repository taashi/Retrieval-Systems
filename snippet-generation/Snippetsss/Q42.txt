computer pattern recognition techniques electrocardiographic diagnosis the use of programmed digital computers as general pattern classification and recognition devices is one phase of the current lively interest in artificial intelligence it is important to choose a class of signals which is at present undergoing a good deal of visual inspection by trained people for the purpose of pattern recognition in this way comparisons between machine and human performance may be obtained a practical result also serves as additional motivation clinical electrocardiograms make up such a class of signals the approach to the problem presented here centers upon the use of multiple adaptive matched filters that classify normalized signals the present report fives some of the background for the application of this method cacm october 1962 stark l okajima m whipple g h ca621018 jb march 17 1978 704 pm

application of game tree searching techniques to sequential pattern recognition a sequential pattern recognition spr procedure does not test all the features of a pattern at once instead it selects a feature to be tested after receiving the result of that test the procedure either classifies the unknown pattern or selects another feature to be tested etc medical diagnosis is an example of spr in this paper the authors suggest that spr be viewed as a one person game played against nature chance virtually all the powerful techniques developed for searching two person strictly competitive game trees can easily be incorporated either directly or by analogy into spr procedures in particular one can incorporate the mini average backing up procedure and the gamma procedure which are the analogues of the minimax backing up procedure and the alpha beta procedure respectively some computer simulated experiments in character recognition are presented the results indicate that the approach is promising cacm february 1971 slagle j r lee r c t sequential pattern recognition game tree searching game against nature gamma procedure mini average backing up procedure dynamic programming branch and bound approach optimal solution 360 363 542 ca710206 jb february 8 1978 856 am

normalization techniques for hand printed numerals family of pattern standardization techniques based on geometrical projection is applied to a file of digitized hand printed numerals obtained from sales clerks the principle involves transforming a quadrilateral specified in terms of the convex hull of each pattern into a square the amount of overlap within each class of characters versus the amount between classes is used to evaluate the degree of normalization achieved with respect to other published methods including size and shear normalization through moments cacm august 1970 nagy g tuong n pattern recognition character recognition normalization projective transformation central projection hand printed characters handwriting linear transformation size normalization mapping pattern preprocessor 363 514 ca700802 jb february 10 1978 403 pm

pictorial pattern recognition and the phase problem of x ray crystallography the availability of interactive three dimensional computer graphics systems coupled to powerful digital computers encourages the development of algorithms adapted to this environment pictorial pattern recognition techniques make possible a number of approaches to x ray structure determination based on molecular model building ie the use of chemical information to frame structural hypotheses which can computationally be tested and refined by reference to the experimental data application of standard pattern recognition algorithms is hindered by the fact that the cross correlation between a model and the correct structure cannot be computed because of a fundamental incompleteness in the measured data however it is possible to compute an upper bound to such a cross correlation a simple example demonstrates that this information can be the basis of a technique for structure determination that can make effective use of an interactive graphics system model building by cross correlations has intrinsic advantages over usual crystallographic techniques based on the autocorrelation or patterson function especially for large structures this is significant for crystallography of biological macromolecules hasbeen and will continue to be a field of intense interest cacm january 1972 lesk a m pictorial pattern recognition phase problem x ray crystallography interactive graphics 313 317 363 ca720101 jb february 1 1978 953 am

system performance evaluation survey and appraisal the state of the art of system performance evaluation is reviewed and evaluation goals and problems are examined throughput turnaround and availability are defined as fundamental measures of performance overhead and cpu speed are placed in perspective the appropriateness of instruction mixes kernels simulators and other tools is discussed as well as pitfalls which may be encountered when using them analysis simulation and synthesis are presented as three levels of approach to evaluation requiring successively greater amounts of information the central role of measurement in performance evaluation and in the development of evaluation methods is explored cacm january 1967 calingaert p ca670102 jb march 1 1978 910 am

structural pattern recognition of carotid pulse waves using a general waveform parsing system a general waveform parsing system with application to structural pattern recognition of carotid pulse waves is described the carotid arterial pulse wave is of medical importance because of variation in its structure induced by arterial aging and cardiovascular disease the syntax driven waveform analysis system has been applied with good results to these pulse waves to detect and measure structural variations the waveform parsing system is modeled on a compiler compiler system and allows the user to enter application specific information as data it is thus general enough to be applicable to other waveforms cacm december 1976 stockman g kanal l kyle m c structural pattern recognition parsing waveform analysis pulse waves 312 334 363 412 ca761204 jb january 3 1978 143 pm
