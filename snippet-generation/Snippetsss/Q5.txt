an interactive graphical display monitor in a batch processing environment with remote entry a graphic monitor program is described it was developed at carnegie mellon university for the cdc g21 computer which is a general purpose batch processing system with remote entry the existing g21 system and the graphics hardware are described the graphic monitor is a resident auxiliary monitor which provides comprehensive managerial capability over the graphical system in response to commands from the human user it also will respond to commands from a user program through a similar interface where routine calls take the place of manual actions thus the human and program can interact on a symmetrical and equal basis through the medium of the graphic monitor the choice made in designing the graphic monitor given the constraints of the existing hardware and computer system are discussed the structure of the monitor program and the human and program interfaces are described there is also a transient swapping version with a small resident part and provision for swapped used submonitors cacm november 1969 bond a h rightnour j graphic monitor manmachine interaction graphic interface graphic in batch environment design of graphical system 430 431 439 441 ca691101 jb february 15 1978 122 pm

an interactive software system for computers aided design an application to circuit project the characteristics of an interactive software system intended to constitute an interface between designer and computer during various steps of the design process are presented the main emphasis is given to the description of the features of the two high level user oriented languages operating at different levels on which the interaction is based the first one is imol an interactive monitor language which is designed to perform the overall and control functions of the software system its design criteria provide the user with commands which are both simple and efficient in order to perform all the functions needed in computer aided circuit design the second one is coif a circuit oriented graphic language which is designed to describe generate and manipulate graphic problem specifications it is an extension of fortran with graphic type variables so that the designer who is familiar with fortran need not learn a new language the application to computer aided circuit design is in particular examined on the other hand the adopted design criteria provide sufficient generality to extend the use of the two languages to different computer assisted applications cacm september 1970 bracchi g somalvico m interaction graphics computer graphics computer aided design circuit design software system software organization language monitor language graphic language extended fortran 324 325 413 422 43 ca700902 jb february 10 1978 220 pm

on the design of display processors the flexibility and power needed in the data channel for a computer display are considered to work efficiently such a channel must have a sufficient number of instructions that it is best understood as a small processor rather than a powerful channel as it was found that successive improvements to the display processor design lie on a circular path by making improvements one can return to the original simple design plus one new general purpose computer for each trip around the degree of physical separation between display and parent computer is a key factor in display processor design cacm june 1968 myer t h display processor design display system computer graphics graphic terminal displays graphics display generator display channel display programming graphical interaction remote displays 244 622 629 635 ca680603 jb february 22 1978 441 pm

on the interface between computers and data communications systems future systems that combine computers digital terminals and communications equipment present design optimization problems that require reconsideration of the traditional functional responsibilities of the respective subsystems several standard interfaces by means of which computers and digital terminals connect to the communications systems will be required when specifying these interfaces consideration must be given to problems of coordination synchronization error control signaling stream multiplexing and switch control in addition to minimizing the technological interdependence of specific subsystem designs a focus on some of the problems is obtained in a discussion of a detailed specification for a particular computer communications system interface cacm july 1972 fraser a g communications standard interface communications protocol virtual channel multiplexed inputoutput coordination of inputoutput 381 60 635 ca720707 jb january 30 1978 246 pm

an algol like computer design language the idea of constructing a computer design language by making use of an algol like programming language is presented a computer designer can benefit from using a design language at a higher level just as a computer user can benefit from a higher level programming language the purposes and requirements of the design language are enumerated to achieve most of the purposes a translator is required to translate a design of computer logic into a set of boolean equations the design language is presented in terms of vocabulary statements sequences and microprogram included are examples of identifiers expressions with both unary and binary operators declaration statements transfer statements terminal statements exchange statements if statements do statements go to statements several sequences and a microprogram cacm october 1965 chu y ca651007 jb march 6 1978 648 pm

a statistical model for console behavior in multiuser computers the ability of a computer system to communicate with the outside world efficiently is as important as its ability to perform computations efficiently it is quite difficult to characterize a particular user but rather easy to characterize the entire user community based on the properties of this community we have postulated a hypothetical virtual console no claim is made that a virtual console behaves like any actual console but the entire collection of virtual consoles models the collection of actual consoles using the model we answer questions like how many processes are suspended waiting for console input what is the maximum rate at which a process can execute what bounds can be set on overall buffer requirements answers to these and similar questions are needed in certain aspects of operating system design cacm september 1968 denning p j statistical models for input output operating system design input output design 430 441 55 ca680903 jb february 22 1978 921 am
