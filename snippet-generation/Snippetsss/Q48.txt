a comparison of tree balancing algorithms several algorithms height balance ie avl and extensions weight balance ie bb and wb and total restructuring for building balanced binary search trees are compared the criteria for comparison encompass theoretical aspects eg path lengths and implementation independent and machinealgorithm dependent measures eg run time a detailed analysis of code is also presented at a level believed to be language and compiler independent the quality of the resulting trees and the overhead spent on building them are analyzed and some guidelines are given for an efficient use of the methods if insertion and subsequent queries are the only operations of in terest then pure avl trees present the overall best qualities cacm may 1977 baer j l schwab b binary search trees avl trees weight balanced trees path length analysis of algorithms information storage and retrieval 37 372 374 531 ca770504 jb december 29 1977 216 am

reconstruction of pictures from their projections there are situations in the natural sciences and medicine eg in electron microscopy and x ray photography in which it is desirable to estimate the gray levels of a digital picture at the individual points from the sums of the gray levels along straight lines projections at a few angles usually in such situations the picture is far from determined and the problem is to find the most representative picture three algorithms are described all using monte carlo methods which were designed to solve this problem the algorithms are applicable in a large and varied number of fields the most important uses may be the reconstruction of possibly asymmetric particles from electron micrographs and three dimensional x ray analysis cacm december 1971 gordon r herman g t approximation biomedical image processing efficient encoding image processing linear programming mathematical programming monte carlo techniques optimization picture compression picture description picture processing stereology x ray analysis 312 313 315 317 363 541 56 ca711201 jb february 2 1978 1032 am

formal requirements for virtualizable third generation architectures virtual machine systems have been implemented on a limited number of third generation computer systems eg cp 67 on the ibm 36067 from previous empirical studies it is known that certain third generation computer systems eg the dec pdp 10 cannot support a virtual machine system in this paper model of a third generation like computer system is developed formal techniques are used to derive precise sufficient conditions to test whether such an architecture can support virtual machines cacm july 1974 popek g j goldberg r p operating system third generation architecture sensitive instruction formal requirements abstract model proof virtual machine virtual memory hypervisor virtual machine monitor 432 435 521 522 ca740707 jb january 17 1978 1119 am

experiments with some algorithms that find central solutions for pattern classification in two class pattern recognition it is a standard technique to have an algorithm finding hyperplanes which separates the two classes in a linearly separable training set the traditional methods find a hyperplane which separates all points in the other but such a hyperplane is not necessarily centered in the empty space between the two classes since a central hyperplane does not favor one class or the other it should have a lower error rate in classifying new points and is therefore better than a noncentral hyperplane six algorithms for finding central hyperplanes are tested on three data sets although frequently used practice the modified relaxation algorithm is very poor three algorithms which are defined in the paper are found to be quite good cacm march 1979 slagle j pattern recognition pattern classification linear discriminants central hyperplanes centering centrality criteria dead zone hyperplane linearly separable relaxation algorithm accelerated relaxation 362 363 ca790303 dh april 12 1979 320 pm

an interpretive input routine for linear programming in this descriptive article an input code is presented which greatly simplifies data input to any linear programming solution routine for subsequent use either as a pedagogical device or for solving rather small lp problems this latter limited use derives not at all from inherent limitations in the code itself but from an efficiency evaluation large lp problems would doubtless benefit from an input system more suited for bulk data handling than the input code described from a users standpoint input appears almost exactly as a textbook presentation of the lp problem limited only by a keypunchs inability to write subscripts etc the input interpreter scans column wise thus no fixed format data preparation is required the user may also under very general requirements only liberally use editorial comments throughout the input deck as an aid in identification eg of row constraints the article includes examples of input output from a solution routine presently in use and a skeleton flowchart of the input interpreter cacm january 1967 aigner d j ca670104 jb march 1 1978 858 am
