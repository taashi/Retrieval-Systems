time clocks and the ordering of events in a distributed system the concept of one event happening before another in a distributed system is examined and is shown to define a partial ordering of the events a distributed algorithm is given for synchronizing a system of logical clocks which can be used to totally order the events the use of the total ordering is illustrated with a method for solving synchronization problems the algorithm is then specialized for synchronizing physical clocks and a bound is derived on how far out of synchrony the clocks can become cacm july 1978 lamport l distributed systems computer networks clock synchronization multiprocess systems 432 529 ca780706 dh february 7 1979 430 pm

high level programming for distributed computing programming for distributed and other loosely coupled systems is a problem of growing interest this paper describes an approach to distributed computing at the level of general purpose programming languages based on primitive notions of module message and transaction key the methodology is shown to be independent of particular languages and machines it appears to be useful for programming a wide range of tasks this is part of an ambitious program of development in advanced programming languages and relations with other aspects of the project are also discussed cacm june 1979 feldman j distributed computing modules messages assertions 422 432 ca790604 dh august 21 1979 431 pm

distributed processes a concurrent programming concept a language concept for concurrent processes without common variables is introduced these processes communicate and synchronize by means of procedure calls and guarded regions this concept is proposed for real time applications controlled by microcomputer networks with distributed storage the paper gives several examples of distributed processes and shows that they include procedures coroutines classes monitors processes semaphores buffers path expressions and inputoutput as special cases cacm november 1978 hansen p concurrent programming distributed processes microprocessor networks nondeterminism guarded regions programming languages process communication and scheduling sorting arrays coroutines classes monitors processes semaphores buffers path expressions inputoutput 38 42 422 432 524 ca781108 dh january 26 1979 1040 am

synchronization with eventcounts and sequencers synchronization of concurrent processes requires controlling the relative ordering of events in the processes a new synchronization mechanism is proposed using abstract objects called eventcounts and sequencers that allows processes to control the ordering of events directly rather than using mutual exclusion to protect manipulations of shared variables that control ordering of events direct control of ordering seems to simplify correctness arguments and also simplifies implementation in distributed systems the mechanism is defined formally and then several examples of its use are given the relationship of the mechanism to protection mechanisms in the system is explained in particular eventcounts are shown to be applicable to situations where confinement of information matters an implementation of eventcount s and sequencers in a system with shared memory is described cacm february 1979 reed d kanodia r process synchronization interprocess communication distributed systems security models mutual exclusion semaphores 430 432 ca790207 dh april 12 1979 1003 am

ethernet distributed packet switching for local computer networks ethernet is a branching broadcast communication system for carrying digital data packets among locally distributed computing stations the packet transport mechanism provided by ethernet has been used to build systems which can be viewed as either local computer networks or loosely coupled multiprocessors an ethernets shared communication facility its ether is a passive broadcast medium with no central control coordination of access to the ether for packet broadcasts is distributed among the contending transmitting stations using controlled statistical arbitration switching of packets to their destinations on the ether is distributed among the receiving stations using packet address recognition design principles and implementation are described based on experience with an operating ethernet of 100 nodes along a kilometer of coaxial cable a model for estimating performance under heavy loads and a packet protocol for error controlled communication are included for completeness cacm july 1976 metcalfe r m boggs d r computer networks packet switching multiprocessing distributed control distributed computing broadcast communication statistical arbitration 381 432 635 ca760704 jb january 4 1978 1249 pm

a correctness proof of a topology information main tenance protocol for a distributed computer network in order for the nodes of a distributed computer network to communicate each node must have information about the networks topology since nodes and links sometimes crash a scheme is needed to update this information one of the major constrain ts on such a topology information scheme is that it may not involve a central controller the topology information protocol that was implemented on the merit computer network is presented and explained this protocol is quite general and could be implemented on any computer network it is based on barans hot potato heuristic routing doctrine a correctness proof of this topology information protocol is also presented cacm july 1977 tajibnapis w d distributed computer network correctness proofs computer networks distributed control network topology routing problem in networks distributed operating system store and forward packet switching store and forward message switching traffic control 381 432 ca770703 jb december 28 1977 1159 am
