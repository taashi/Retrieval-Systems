computer generation of gamma random variates with non integral shape parameters when the shape parameter a is integral generating gamma random variables with a digital computer is straightforward there is no simple method for generating gamma random variates with non integral shape parameters a common procedure is to approximately generate such random variables by use of the so called probability switch method another procedure which is exact is due to johnk this paper presents a rejection method for exactly generating gamma random variables when a is greater than 1 the efficiency of the rejection method is shown to be better than the efficiency of johnks method the paper concludes that when a is non integral the following mix of procedures yields the best combination of accuracy and efficiency 1 when a is less than 1 use johnks method 2 when 1 is less than a and a is less than 5 use the rejection method 3 when a is greater than 5 use the probability switch method cacm december 1974 wallace n d simulation gamma random variables probability distribution random numbers 55 81 ca741205 jb january 16 1978 935 am

cold start vs warm start miss ratios in a two level computer storage hierarchy miss ratio measurements are often made from a cold start that is made with the first level store initially empty for large capacities the effect on the measured miss ratio of the misses incurred while filling the first level store can be significant even for long reference strings use of warm start rather than cold start miss ratios cast doubt on the widespread belief that the observed s shape of lifetime reciprocal of miss ratio versus capacity curve indicates a property of behavior of programs that maintain a constant number of pages in main storage on the other hand if cold start miss ratios are measured as a function of capacity and measurement length then they are useful in studying systems in which operation of a program is periodically interrupted by task switches it is shown how to obtain under simple assumptions the cache miss ratio for multiprogramming from cold start miss ratio values and how to obtain approximate cold start miss ratios from warm start miss ratios cacm october 1978 easton m fagin r miss ratio cold start warm start storage hierarchy lifetime function multiprogramming s shape 370 432 935 ca781009 dh january 29 1979 516 pm

sampling from the gamma distribution on a computer this paper describes a method of generating gamma variates that appears to be less costly than wallaces recently suggested method for large shape parameter a the cost of computation is proportional to a whereas wallaces method is proportional to a experimentation by robinson and lewis indicates that for small a the method suggested here also dominates methods recently suggested by dieter and ahrens albeit those methods dominate for large a the method suggested here uses the rejection technique cacm july 1976 fishman g s gamma variates reflection method sampling 55 81 83 ca760706 jb january 4 1978 1234 pm

the synthesis of solids bounded by many faces a technique is presented which allows a class of solid objects to be synthesized and stored using a computer synthesis begins with primitive solids like a cube wedge or cylinder any solid can be moved scaled or rotated solids may also be added together or subtracted two algorithms to perform addition are described for practical designers the technique has the advantage that operations are concise readily composed and are given in terms of easily imagined solidsuite short sequences of operations suffice to build up complex solids bounded by many faces cacm april 1975 braid i c computational geometry computer aided design graphics machined components polyhedra shape synthesis three dimensional modeling 32 82 ca750406 jb january 9 1978 359 pm

computer generation of gamma random variables a new method for generating random variables from the gamma distribution with nonintegral shape parameter a is proposed this method is similar to two other methods recently given by wallace and fishman it is compared with fishmans and ahrens and dieters methods the core storage requirements and programming effort for this method are similar to those of fishmans method the proposed method is the same as fishmans method for 1 a 2 and is faster than fishmans method for 3 a 19 also the proposed method is much simpler than ahrens and dieters method and is faster for a 8 cacm may 1978 tadikamalla p gamma variables rejection method computer methods 55 81 ca780509 dh february 26 1979 110 pm

a generalization of avl trees a generalization of avl trees is proposed in which imbalances up to triangle shape is a small integer an experiment is performed to compare these trees with standard avl trees and with balanced trees on the basis of mean retrieval time of amount of restructuring expected and on the worst case of retrieval time it is shown that by permitting imbalances of up to five units the retrieval time is increased a small amount while the amount of restructuring required is decreased by a factor of ten a few theoretical results are derived including the correction of an earlier paper and are duly compared with the experimental data reasonably good correspondence is found cacm august 1973 foster c c avl trees balanced trees information storage and retrieval 37 372 449 531 ca730819 jb january 23 1978 1013 am

global optimization by suppression of partial redundancies the elimination of redundant computations and the moving of invariant computations out of loops are often done separately with invariants moved outward loop by loop we propose to do both at once and to move each expression directly to the entrance of the outermost loop in which it is invariant this is done by solving a more general problem ie the elimination of computations performed twice on a given execution path such computations are termed partially redundant moreover the algorithm does not require any graphical information or restrictions on the shape of the program graph testing this algorithm has shown that its execution cost is nearly linear with the size of the program and that it leads to a smaller optimizer that requires less execution time cacm february 1979 morel e renvoise c optimizer optimization compiler compilation redundancy elimination invariant computation elimination partial redundancy data flow analysis boolean systems 412 521 524 ca790204 dh april 10 1979 419 pm
