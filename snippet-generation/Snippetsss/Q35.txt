weighted derivation trees the nodes of a weighted derivation tree are associated with weighting functions over the vocabulary of a context free grammar an algorithm is presented for constructing the optimal derivation tree having the same structure as a given weighted derivation tree in addition the correctness of the algorithm is established the method may be applied to problems involving probabilistic parsing or combinatorial optimization cacm september 1976 loui m c derivation tree parse tree probabilistic grammar structural ambiguity combinatorial optimization 523 549 ca760903 jb january 4 1978 941 am

tests of probabilistic models for propagation of roundoff errors in any prolonged computation it is generally assumed that the accumulated effect of roundoff errors is in some sense statistical the purpose of this paper is to give precise descriptions of certain probabilistic models for roundoff error and then to describe a series of experiments for testing the validity of these models it is concluded that the models are in general very good discrepancies are both rare and mild the test techniques can also be used to experiment with various types of special arithmetic cacm february 1966 hull t e swenson j r ca660210 jb march 3 1978 237 pm

breaking substitution ciphers using a relaxation algorithm substitution ciphers are codes in which each letter of the alphabet has one fixed substitute and the word divisions do not change in this paper the problem of breaking substitution ciphers is represented as a probabilistic labeling problem every code letter is assigned probabilities of representing plain text letters these probabilities are updated in parallel for all code letters using joint letter probabilities iterating the updating scheme results in improved estimates that finally lead to breaking the cipher the method is applies successfully to two examples cacm november 1979 peleg s rosenfeld a cryptography substitution ciphers probabilistic classification relaxation 342 363 ca791103 db january 23 1980 1115 am

dynamic memory repacking a probabilistic model of a multiprogramming system is exercised in order to determine the conditions under which the dynamic repacking of main memory is beneficial an expression is derived for the maximum interference that a repacking process may introduce before the original performance of the system is degraded alternative approaches to repacking are discussed and the operating conditions that lead to improved system throughput through repacking are delineated cacm march 1974 balkovich e chiu w presser l wood r dynamic memory repacking memory compaction storage fragmentation multiprogramming system model probabilistic model central processor productivity resource utilization system throughput 432 55 620 ca740302 jb january 18 1978 1237 pm

a queuing model of a multiprogrammed computer with a two level storage system the results are presented of an analysis of a probabilistic model of a multiprogrammed computer system with a two level storage system in which there is sequential dependency of accesses between the devices expressions are obtained for the long run probability that both the cpu and each of the storage devices are busy some numerical results are given which quantify the gains in cpu utilization obtainable by multiprogramming in the presence of this type of storage system cacm january 1973 shedler g s multiprogrammed computer system storage system hierarchical index sets 432 ca730101 jb january 24 1978 455 pm

hierarchical storage in information retrieval a probabilistic analysis is employed to determine the effect of hierarchical storage organizations on information retrieval operations the data storage hardware is assumed to consist on n levels of linearly connected memory hardware with increasing data access times and increasing data storage capabilities a system might for example consist of fast semiconductor memory computer core memory extended core storage disk memory and data cells equations are derived to predict the effect of such a system on data access times using sequential files random access files and structured files employing multiple hierarchical linked lists cacm may 1973 salasin j information retrieval hierarchical storage 370 372 373 374 379 390 620 634 ca730504 jb january 24 1978 848 am

a method for composing simple traditional music by computer a method is described for composing musical rounds by computer this method uses some music theory plus additional heuristics fundamental to the method is a set of productions together with sets of applicability rules and weight rules which operate on the productions deciding when and to what extent they are available for use several rounds generated by the computer implementation of the method are presented generally the resultant music sounds mediocre to the professional although usually pleasing to the layman it appears that full blown music theory is not needed for rounds all the hardware required for structural levels is not necessary for these pieces the author has tried to address both musicians and computer scientists cacm november 1974 rader g m artificial intelligence heuristic programming models of cognitive processes computer music computer composition music theory formal languages probabilistic grammars 344 365 523 ca741104 jb january 16 1978 1035 am

general performance analysis of key to address transformation methods using an abstract file concept this paper presents a new approach to the analysis of performance of the various key to address transformation methods in this approach the keys in a file are assumed to have been selected from the key space according to a certain probabilistic selection algorithm all files with the same number of keys selected from this key space will be suitably weighted in accordance with the algorithm and the average performance of the transformation methods on these files will be used as the potential of these methods using this analysis methods with the same overall performance can be classified and key distributions partial to certain transformations can be identified all this can be done analytically the approach is applied to a group of transformation methods using files whose keys are selected randomly cacm october 1973 lum v y hashing hashing techniques hashing methods hash coding key transformation key to address transformation direct addressing randomizing random access scatter storage information retrieval hashing analysis randomization performance analysis 37 372 373 374 379 49 59 ca731003 jb january 20 1978 1151 am
