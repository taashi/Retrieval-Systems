a model of memory contention in a paging machine this paper is concerned with certain aspects of contention for main memory resources in a multiprogrammed computer system operating under demand paging in the model presented the number of page frames of main memory allocated to a problem program varies in time these changes in memory configuration are represented explicitly in the model cpu requirements and page exception characteristics of program material being described statistically expressions for the distribution of the number of page frames allocated to an executing program the long run expected fraction of a programs execution time in a given number of page frames and the average execution interval of the multiprogrammed load are obtained it is pointed out heuristically and demonstrated numerically that an increase is obtain able in the average execution interval of the multiprogrammed load over that resulting from equal fixed partitioning of main memory cacm august 1972 oden p h shedler g s paging machines demand paging operating systems studies queuing analysis memory contention memory management 432 ca720805 jb january 30 1978 950 am

the multics virtual memory concepts and design as experience with use of on line operating systems has grown the need to share information among system users has become increasingly apparent many contemporary systems permit some degree of sharing usually sharing is accomplished by allowing several users to share data via input and output of information stored in files kept in secondary storage through the use of segmentation however multics provides direct hardware addressing by user and system programs of all information independent of its physical storage location information is stored in segments each of which is potentially sharable and carries its own independent attributes of size and access privilege here the design and implementation considerations of segmentation and sharing in multics are first discussed under the assumption that all information resides in large segmented main memory since the size of main memory on contemporary systems is rather limited it is then shown how the multics software achieves the effect of a large segmented main memory through the use of the honeywell 645 segmentation and paging hardware cacm may 1972 bensoussan a clingen c t daley r c operating system multics virtual memory segmentation information sharing paging memory management memory hierarchy 430 431 432 ca720502 jb january 31 1978 1124 am

operating system performance an overview of the current and future positions with respect to operating system performance is given while a great deal of information and a large number of models for subsystems have been developed gaps still exist in out knowledge because of the severe interactions between the various subsystems of an operating system an overall model of the total system must be developed to be able to analyze and design the performance aspects of an operating system although such total system designs are exceptional today it is projected that they will become increasingly more common and necessary in the near future such a design philosophy will clearly have a severe impact on the way we go about modularizing operating and computer systems cacm july 1972 lynch w c computer system operating system performance evaluation performance measurement measurement techniques modularity layering structured programming paging virtual memory inputoutput disk storage facility drum storage facility sector queueing 430 620 ca720709 jb january 30 1978 233 pm

anomalies with variable partition paging algorithms five types of anomalous behavior which may occur in paged virtual memory operating systems a redefined one type of anomaly for example concerns the fact that with certain reference strings and paging algorithms an increase in mean memory allocation may result in an increase in fault rate two paging algorithms are examined in terms of their anomaly potential and reference string examples of various anomalies are presented two paging algorithm properties the inclusion property and the generalized inclusion property are discussed and the anomaly implications of these properties presented cacm march 1978 franklin m graham g gupta r anomaly memory management program behavior stack algorithms virtual memory working set page fault frequency paging algorithms 432 435 46 81 ca780307 jb march 28 1978 101 pm

a data definition and mapping language a data definition language i sa declarative computer language for specifying data structures most data definition languages concentrate on the declaration of logical data structures with little concern for how these structures are physically realized on a computer system however the need for data definition languages which describe both the logical and physical aspects of data is increasingly apparent such languages will be a key systems as well as in advanced data management systems and distributed data bases this paper reviews past work in the data definition language for describing both logical and physical aspects of data applications of these generalized data definition languages are also discussed cacm december 1973 sibley e h taylor r w data definition language data and storage structure data translation data base management systems file translation 351 370 373 429 482 ca731202 jb january 19 1978 258 pm

the working set model for program behavior probably the most basic reason behind the absence of a general treatment of resource allocation in modern computer systems is an adequate model for program behavior in this paper a new model the working set model is developed the working set of pages associated with a process defined to be the collection of its most recently used pages provides knowledge vital to the dynamic management of paged memories process and working set are shown to be manifestations of the same ongoing computational activity then processor demand and memory demand are defined and resource allocation is formulated as the problem of balancing demands against available equipment cacm may 1968 denning p j general operating system concepts multiprocessing multiprogramming operating systems program behavior program models resource allocation scheduling storage allocation 430 432 ca680505 jb february 23 1978 933 am
