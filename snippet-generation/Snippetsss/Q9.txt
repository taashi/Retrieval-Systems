a model for verification of data security in operating systems program verification applied to kernel architectures forms a promising method for providing uncircumventably secure shared computer systems a precise definition of data security is developed here in terms of a general model for operating systems this model is suitable as a basis for verifying many of those properties of an operating system which are necessary to assure reliable enforcement of security the application of this approach to the ucla secure operating system is also discussed cacm september 1978 popek g farber d operating systems security protection program verification 435 524 ca780904 dh february 5 1979 240 pm

ethernet distributed packet switching for local computer networks ethernet is a branching broadcast communication system for carrying digital data packets among locally distributed computing stations the packet transport mechanism provided by ethernet has been used to build systems which can be viewed as either local computer networks or loosely coupled multiprocessors an ethernets shared communication facility its ether is a passive broadcast medium with no central control coordination of access to the ether for packet broadcasts is distributed among the contending transmitting stations using controlled statistical arbitration switching of packets to their destinations on the ether is distributed among the receiving stations using packet address recognition design principles and implementation are described based on experience with an operating ethernet of 100 nodes along a kilometer of coaxial cable a model for estimating performance under heavy loads and a packet protocol for error controlled communication are included for completeness cacm july 1976 metcalfe r m boggs d r computer networks packet switching multiprocessing distributed control distributed computing broadcast communication statistical arbitration 381 432 635 ca760704 jb january 4 1978 1249 pm

on the implementation of security measures in information systems the security of an information system may be represented by a model matrix whose elements are decision rules and whose row and column indices are users and data items respectively a set of four functions is used to access this matrix at translation and execution time distinguishing between data dependent and data independent decision rules enables one to perform much of the checking of security only once at translation time rather than repeatedly at execution time the model is used to explain security features of several existing systems and serves as a framework for a proposal for general security system implementation within todays languages and operating systems cacm april 1972 conway r w maxwell w l morgan h l security privacy access control confidentiality operating systems access management data banks management information systems 350 373 412 422 439 ca720401 jb january 31 1978 159 pm

a correctness proof of a topology information main tenance protocol for a distributed computer network in order for the nodes of a distributed computer network to communicate each node must have information about the networks topology since nodes and links sometimes crash a scheme is needed to update this information one of the major constrain ts on such a topology information scheme is that it may not involve a central controller the topology information protocol that was implemented on the merit computer network is presented and explained this protocol is quite general and could be implemented on any computer network it is based on barans hot potato heuristic routing doctrine a correctness proof of this topology information protocol is also presented cacm july 1977 tajibnapis w d distributed computer network correctness proofs computer networks distributed control network topology routing problem in networks distributed operating system store and forward packet switching store and forward message switching traffic control 381 432 ca770703 jb december 28 1977 1159 am

a high security log in procedure the protection of time sharing systems from unauthorized users is often achieved by the use of passwords by using one way ciphers to code the passwords the risks involved with storing the passwords in the computer can be avoided we discuss the selection of a suitable one way cipher and suggest that for this purpose polynomials over a prime modulus are superior to one way ciphers derived from sannon codes cacm august 1974 purdy g b operating systems time sharing systems security cryptography 435 ca740803 jb january 17 1978 1010 am

time clocks and the ordering of events in a distributed system the concept of one event happening before another in a distributed system is examined and is shown to define a partial ordering of the events a distributed algorithm is given for synchronizing a system of logical clocks which can be used to totally order the events the use of the total ordering is illustrated with a method for solving synchronization problems the algorithm is then specialized for synchronizing physical clocks and a bound is derived on how far out of synchrony the clocks can become cacm july 1978 lamport l distributed systems computer networks clock synchronization multiprocess systems 432 529 ca780706 dh february 7 1979 430 pm

dynamic response time prediction for computer networks if the ultimate aim of a computing network is resource sharing then the human component as well as the technical component of networking must be fully investigated to achieve this goal this research is a first step toward assisting the user in participating in the vast store of resources available on a network analytical simulation and statistical performance evaluation tools are employed to investigate the feasibility of a dynamic response time monitor that is capable of providing comparative response time information for users wishing to process various computing applications at some network computing node the research clearly reveals that sufficient system data are currently obtainable at least for the five diverse arpa network systems studied in detail to describe and predict the response time for network time sharing systems as it depends on some measure of system activity or load level cacm july 1977 mamrak s a response time monitor computer networks time sharing systems comparative response time arpa network anlytic modeling simulation benchmark jobs system measurement 46 620 81 ca770701 jb december 28 1977 1242 pm

exclusive simulation of activity in digital networks a technique for simulating the detailed logic networks of large and active digital systems is described essential objectives sought are improved ease and economy in model generation economy in execution time and space and a facility for handling simultaneous activities the main results obtained are a clear and useful separation of structural and behavioral model description a reduction of manual tasks in converting boolean logic into a structural model the elimination of manual processes in achieving exclusive simulation of activity an event scheduling technique which does not deteriorate in economy as the event queue grows in length and a simulation procedure which deals effectively with any mixture of serial and simultaneous activities the passage of time is simulated in a precise quantitative fashion and systems to be simulated may be combinations of synchronous and asynchronous logic certain aspects of the techniques described may be used for the simulation of network structures other than digital networks cacm february 1969 ulrich e g simulation logical simulation digital simulation large systems simulation network structures scheduling queuing simultaneous activities parallel events 422 429 69 ca690210 jb february 20 1978 958 am
