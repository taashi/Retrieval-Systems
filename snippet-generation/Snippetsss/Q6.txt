interactive skeleton techniques for enhancing motion dynamics in key frame animation a significant increase in the capability for controlling motion dynamics in key frame animation is achieved through skeleton control this technique allows an animator to develop a complex motion sequence by animating a stick figure representation of an image this control sequence is then used to drive an image sequence through the same movement the simplicity of the stick figure image encourages a high level of interaction during the design stage its compatibility with the basic key frame animation technique permits skeleton control to be applied selectively to only those components of a composite image sequence that require enhancement cacm october 1976 burtnyk n wein m interactive graphics computer generated animation key frame animation interactive skeleton control stick figure animation 341 349 49 82 ca761005 jb january 3 1978 424 pm

computer formulation of the equations of motion using tensor notation a means is described for extending the area of application of digital computers beyond the numerical data processing stage and reducing the need for human participation in the formulation of certain types of computer problems by the use of tensor calculus and a computer language designed to facilitate symbolic mathematical computation a method has been devised whereby a digital computer can be used to do non numeric work that is symbolic algebraic manipulation and differentiation to illustrate the techniques involved a digital computer has been used to derive the equations of motion of a point mass in a general orthogonal curvilinear coordinate system since this operation involves a formulation in terms of first and second order differential coefficients it provides a good demonstration of a computers capability to do non numeric work and to assist in the formulation process which normally precedes the numerical data processing stage moreover this particular problem serves to illustrate the advantages of the mathematical techniques employed with the program prepared for this purpose the computer will derive the equations of motion in any coordinate system requested by the user results are presented for the following coordinate systems cylindrical polar spherical polar and prolate spheroidal cacm september 1967 howard j c ca670903 jb february 27 1978 358 pm

a decision matrix as the basis for a simple data input routine currently a great deal of time and effort is being spent on the development of bigger and better compiler languages multiprogram executive systems etc since the implementation of of new methods and procedures is not instantaneous but rather occurs by an evolutionary process we should be concerned also with the problem of maintaining improving and incorporating new ideas into existing systems it is with this somewhat neglected area that the author is interested a method employing a decision matrix is presented for the handling of a standard systems programming problem that of providing a data input routine cacm december 1962 vasilakos g j ca621204 jb march 17 1978 515 pm

hierarchical geometric models for visible surface algorithms the geometric structure inherent in the definition of the shapes of three dimensional objects and environments is used not just to define their relative motion and placement but also to assist in solving many other problems of systems for producing pictures by computer by using an extension of traditional structure information or a geometric hierarchy five significant improvements to current techniques are possible first the range of complexity of an environment is greatly increased while the visible complexity of any given scene is kept within a fixed upper limit second a meaningful way is provided to vary the amount of detail presented in a scene third clipping becomes a very fast logarithmic search for the resolvable parts of the environment within the field of view fourth frame to frame coherence and clipping define a graphical working set or fraction of the total structure that should be present in primary store for immediate access by the visible surface algorithm finally the geometric structure suggests a recursive descent visible surface algorithm in which the computation time potentially grows linearly with the visible complexity of the scene cacm october 1976 clark j h visible surface algorithms hidden surface algorithms hierarchical data structures geometric models 531 82 ca761003 jb january 3 1978 442 pm

machine controls for analysis of variance a major problem in using the analysis of variance as the number of factors increases is the exponential rise in the number of interactions even though the experimenter may not be interested in these interactions it is impossible to ignore them in most experimental designs because of the problem of getting error terms it is natural therefore to look to the computer to handle the bulk of work involved in computing the interactions a program device to get the computer to do this is described cacm august 1964 weldon r j ca640816 jb march 9 1978 637 pm

analysis of a file addressing method this paper presents a new file addressing method based on the calculation of an address from the identification of a record for large recirculating type files it seems to be more advantageous than customary ones the probability distribution of the displacement of records from their calculated address which is one less than the number of probes required to address a record is computed on the basis of a markov chain model for the reader not interested in the mathematics the introduction and the summary should be sufficient cacm august 1962 schay jr g spruth w g ca620836 jb march 17 1978 902 pm
