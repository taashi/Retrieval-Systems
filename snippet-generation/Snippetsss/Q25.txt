some criteria for time sharing system performance time sharing systems as defined in this article are those multiaccess systems which permit a terminal user to utilize essentially the full resources of the system while sharing its time with other terminal users it is each terminal users ability to utilize the full resources of the system that makes quantitative evaluation of time sharing systems particularly difficult six criteria are described which have been successfully used to perform first level quantitative time sharing system performance evaluation cacm january 1969 stimler s time sharing performance criteria time sharing system operation time sharing performance analysis 240 430 432 620 ca690111 jb february 20 1978 1137 am

a software design and evaluation system a critical failure of current software system design and implementation methodology is that the performance of a proposed design is not evaluated before it is actually implemented in this paper the reasons for this failure are explored and a new methodology which overcomes many of the difficulties is proposed a system which integrates performance evaluation with design and implementation is described this system is based on a simple high level language which is used to describe the evolving system at all stages of its development the source language description is used as direct input to performance analysis and simulation routines using the performance information obtained from these routines as feedback the problems which adversely affect performance are detected early enough so that they can be corrected without costly major reimplementation of the proposed system cacm february 1973 graham r m clancy g j jr devaney d b operating system development language processing software evaluation compilers system programming supervisory systems debugging program maintenance modeling system integration simulation 40 412 422 430 442 443 81 ca730206 jb january 24 1978 207 pm

operating system performance an overview of the current and future positions with respect to operating system performance is given while a great deal of information and a large number of models for subsystems have been developed gaps still exist in out knowledge because of the severe interactions between the various subsystems of an operating system an overall model of the total system must be developed to be able to analyze and design the performance aspects of an operating system although such total system designs are exceptional today it is projected that they will become increasingly more common and necessary in the near future such a design philosophy will clearly have a severe impact on the way we go about modularizing operating and computer systems cacm july 1972 lynch w c computer system operating system performance evaluation performance measurement measurement techniques modularity layering structured programming paging virtual memory inputoutput disk storage facility drum storage facility sector queueing 430 620 ca720709 jb january 30 1978 233 pm
