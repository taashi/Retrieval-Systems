automatic data structure choice in a language of very high level setl is a set theoretically oriented language of very high level whose repertoire of semantic objects includes finite sets ordered n tuples and sets of ordered n tuples usable as mappings this paper describes the structure of an optimizer for this language among other methods of interest the optimizer uses techniques which allow relations of inclusion and membership to be established the domains and ranges of tabulated mappings to be estimated from above and below and the single valuedness of tabulated mappings to be proved once facts of this kind have been established automatic choice of data structures becomes possible the methods employed are based upon and extend known techniques of data flow analysis cacm december 1975 schwartz j t program optimization automatic programming high level languages set theoretic languages data structure choice 412 420 422 ca751208 jb january 5 1978 353 pm

a very high level programming language for data processing applications application development today is too labor in tensive in recent years very high level languages have been increasingly explored as a solution to this problem the business definition language bdl is such a language one aimed at business data processing problems the concepts in bdl mimic those which have evolved through the years in businesses using manual methods this results in three different sublanguages or components one for defining the business forms one for describing the business organization and one for writing calculations cacm november 1977 hammer m owe w g kruskal v j wladawsky i very high level language nonprocedural language data flow language business application business data processing structured programming modular programming format specification and design methodology 350 422 432 ca771110 jb december 27 1977 706 am

convert a high level translation definition language for data conversion this paper describes a high level and nonprocedural translation definition language convert which provides very powerful and highly flexible data restructuring capabilities its design is based on the simple underlying concept of a form which enables the users to visualize the translation processes and thus makes data translation a much simpler task convert has been chosen for conveying the purpose of the language and should not be confused with any other language or program bearing the same name cacm october 1975 shu n c housel b c lum v y data conversion data restructuring data translation database reorganization translation definition utility program programming languages nonprocedural languages 350 375 429 44 49 ca751002 jb january 6 1978 145 pm

high level programming for distributed computing programming for distributed and other loosely coupled systems is a problem of growing interest this paper describes an approach to distributed computing at the level of general purpose programming languages based on primitive notions of module message and transaction key the methodology is shown to be independent of particular languages and machines it appears to be useful for programming a wide range of tasks this is part of an ambitious program of development in advanced programming languages and relations with other aspects of the project are also discussed cacm june 1979 feldman j distributed computing modules messages assertions 422 432 ca790604 dh august 21 1979 431 pm

high level data flow analysis in contrast to the predominant use of low level in termediate text high level data flow analysis deals with programs essentially at source level and exploits the control flow information implicit in the parse tree the need for high level flow analysis arises from several aspects of recent work on advanced methods of program certification and optimization this paper proposes a simple general method of high level data flow analysis that allows free use of escape and jump statements avoids large graphs when compiling large programs facilitates updating of data flow information to reflect program changes and derives new global information helpful in solving many familiar global flow analysis problems an illustrative application to live variable analysis is presented many of the graphs involved are constructed and analyzed before any programs are compiled thus avoiding certain costs that low level methods incur repeatedly at compile time cacm october 1977 rosen b k data flow analysis high level language control flow graph structured programming escapes exits jumps goto statements 524 412 422 ca771003 jb december 27 1977 1141 am
