the use of normal multiplication tables for information storage and retrieval this paper describes a method for the organization and retrieval of attribute based information systems using the normal multiplication table as a directory for the information system algorithms for the organization an d retrieval of information are described this method is particularly suitable for queries requesting a group of information items all of which possess a particular set of attributes and possibly some other attributes as well several examples are given the results with respect to the number of disk accesses and disk space are compared to other common approaches algorithms evaluating the appropriateness of the above approach to a given information system are described for a certain class of information systems the normal multiplication table method yields far more rapid retrieval with a more economical space requirement than conventional systems moreover this method incorporates an improved modification of the inverted file technique cacm march 1979 motzkin d information retrieval inverted files multiattribute retrieval multilist file normal multiplication table queries rapid retrieval space economy 370 373 379 ca790305 dh may 21 1979 946 am

on the expected gain from adjust ing matched term retrieval systems a file adjustment procedure based on maximizing the bayes expected gain proposed for matched term retrieval systems the expected gain and its probability distribution are derived as a function of 1 the prior proportion of omitted terms and 2 the coefficient of separation between two distributions corresponding to values of an adjustment statistic an example evaluates the gain parameters for a typical information retrieval system cacm november 1967 shumway r h ca671106 jb february 26 1978 259 pm

a stochastic evaluation model for database organization in data retrieval systems experimental work in the valuation of large scale data retrieval systems has been scarce due to its difficulty and prohibitive cost this paper discusses a simulation model of a data retrieval system which has the effect of significantly reducing the cost of experimentation and enabling research never attempted before the model is designed to estimate the retrieval workload of alternative data retrieval systems these data retrieval systems can be organized under several database organizations including inverted list threaded list and cellular list organizations and hybrid combinations of these systems effectiveness of the methodology is demonstrated by using the model to study the effect of database organizations in data retrieval systems in particular the impact of query complexity is analyzed cacm february 1976 siler k f database architecture database performance and evaluation invented list threaded list cellular list information retrieval database organizations query complexity stochastic model monte carlo simulation 370 371 372 373 374 379 ca760205 jb january 5 1978 920 am

an interrupt based organization for management information systems a programming structure language constructs and a supervisory system organization are proposed for the design and coding of large shared data base systems the bases for this organization are a generalized interrupt structure and the newly introduced concept of file tagging which is the process of associating program structures and interrupt generating conditions with items in the data base an algorithm for resolving conflicts which arise in scheduling the interrupt processing routines is presented dpl a programming language and supervisory system in which these concepts are implemented is used to illustrated the new organization which is proposed for management information systems cacm december 1970 morgan h l management information systems integrated data processing supervisors interrupts monitoring systems supervisory systems interrupt scheduling parallel processing 351 422 432 ca701204 jb february 9 1978 346 pm

experimental evaluation of information retrieval through a teletypewriter experiments designed to evaluate the capabilities of mechanized information retrieval systems with emphasis on interactive man machine language and on some of the mechanical and psychological limitations in their design were conducted at the moore school information systems laboratory the basic assumption of the research is that an information retrieval system that provides for man machine dialogue at a remote inquiry terminal should provide a searcher with many of the tools which would be available to him were he actually performing his search at a library or repository of documents factors involved in evaluation of such a system include ease of use learning time and effectiveness of actual retrieval three experiments and the conclusions resulting from them are detailed cacm september 1968 rubinoff m bergman s franks w rubinoff e information retrieval testing information system evaluation experimental document retrieval document retrieval document perusal man machine communication remote console communication teletypewriter communication remote terminal communication retrieval command language symbolic command language interactive systems user learning factors on line searching 372 374 379 381 ca680902 jb february 22 1978 930 am
