a case study in programming for parallel processors an affirmative partial answer is provided to the question of whether it is possible to program parallel processor computing systems to efficiently decrease execution time for useful problems parallel processor systems are multiprocessor systems in which several of the processors can simultaneously execute separate tasks of a single job thus cooperating to decrease the solution time of a computational problem the processors have independent instruction counters meaning that each processor executes its own task program relatively independently of the other processors communication between cooperating processors is by means of data in storage shared by all processors a program for the determination of the distribution of current in an electrical network was written for a parallel processor computing system and execution of this program was simulated the data gathered from simulation runs demonstrate the efficient solution of this problem typical of a large class of important problems it is shown that with proper programming solution time when n processors are applied approaches 1n times the solution time for a single processor while improper programming can actually lead to an increase of solution time with the number of processors stability of the method of solution was also investigated cacm december 1969 rosenfeld j l parallel processor parallelism parallel programming multiprocessor multiprogramming tasking storage interference electrical network simulation relaxation jacobi gauss seidel convergence 324 49 514 517 621 ca691201 jb february 15 1978 445 pm

merging with parallel processors consider two linearly ordered sets a b am bn mn and p pm parallel processors working synchronously the paper presents an algorithm for merging a and b with the p parallel processors which requires at most 2log2 2m13mp mplog2 nm steps if n 2bm b an integer the algorithm requires at most 2log2 m1 mp2b steps in the case where m and n are of the same order of magnitude ie nkm with k being a constant the algorithm requires 2log2 m1 mp3k steps these performances compare very favorably with the previous best parallel merging algorithm batchers algorithm which requires np mn2plog2 m steps in the general case and kmp k12mplog2 m in the special case where nkm cacm october 1975 gavril f parallel processing parallel merging parallel binary insertion 531 ca751005 jb january 6 1978 1050 am

computing connected components on parallel computers we present a parallel algorithm which uses n2 processors to find the connected components of an undirected graph with n vertices in time olog2n an olog2n time bound also can be achieved using only nnlog2n processors the algorithm can be used to find the transitive closure of a symmetric boolean matrix we assume that the processors have access to a common memory simultaneous access to the same location is permitted for fetch instructions but not for store instructions cacm august 1979 hirschberg d chandra a sarwate d graph theory parallel processing algorithms transitive closure connected component 525 532 622 ca790802 db january 4 1980 1218 pm

file organization the consecutive retrieval property the consecutive retrieval property is an important relation between a query set and record set its existence enables the design of an information retrieval system with a minimal search time and no redundant storage some important theorems on the consecutive retrieval property are proved in this paper conditions under which the consecutive retrieval property exists and remain invariant have been established an outline for designing an information retrieval system based on the consecutive retrieval property is also discussed cacm september 1972 ghosh s p file organization consecutive storage consecutive retrieval information retrieval record organization query structure record structure storage on tapes storage space minimum access time 370 373 374 ca720902 jb january 27 1978 452 pm

everymans information retrieval system the information retrieval problem whose solution is presented here was posed by a technical library with limited bubget and personnel the solution however is quite general and is applicable to many different types of retrieval problems further the method of solution makes it possible for many groups who have previously dismissed an information retrieval program as expensive and difficult from a programming stand point to reconsider their position for the present solution makes it possible to install an information retrieval program in less than three months and with relatively little equipment cacm march 1963 whitley v w ca630329 jb march 14 1978 1237 pm

experimental evaluation of information retrieval through a teletypewriter experiments designed to evaluate the capabilities of mechanized information retrieval systems with emphasis on interactive man machine language and on some of the mechanical and psychological limitations in their design were conducted at the moore school information systems laboratory the basic assumption of the research is that an information retrieval system that provides for man machine dialogue at a remote inquiry terminal should provide a searcher with many of the tools which would be available to him were he actually performing his search at a library or repository of documents factors involved in evaluation of such a system include ease of use learning time and effectiveness of actual retrieval three experiments and the conclusions resulting from them are detailed cacm september 1968 rubinoff m bergman s franks w rubinoff e information retrieval testing information system evaluation experimental document retrieval document retrieval document perusal man machine communication remote console communication teletypewriter communication remote terminal communication retrieval command language symbolic command language interactive systems user learning factors on line searching 372 374 379 381 ca680902 jb february 22 1978 930 am

data manipulation and programming problems in automatic information retrieval automatic information retrieval programs require the manipulation of a variety of different data structures including linear text sparse matrices and tree or list structures the main data manipulations to be performed in automatic information systems are first briefly reviewed a variety of data representations which have been used to describe structured information are then examined and the characteristics of various processing languages are outlined in the light of the procedures requiring implementation advantages of these programming languages for the retrieval application are examined and suggestions are made for the design of programming facilities to aid in information retrieval cacm march 1966 salton g ca660315 jb march 3 1978 1135 am
