an english language question answering system for a large relational database by typing requests in english casual users will be able to obtain explicit answers from a large relational database of aircraft flight and maintenance data using a system called planes the design and implementation of this system is described and illustrated with detailed examples of the operation of system components and examples of overall system operation the language processing portion of the system uses a number of augmented transition networks each of which matches phrases with a specific meaning along with context registers his tory keepers and concept case frames these are used for judging meaningfulness of questions generating dialogue for clarifying partially understood questions and resolving ellipsis and pronoun reference problems other system components construct a formal query for the relational database and optimize the order of searching relations methods are discussed for handling vague or complex questions and for providing browsing ability also included are discussions of important issues in programming natural language systems for limited domains and the relationship of this system to others cacm july 1978 waltz d question answering relational database natural language database front end artificial intelligence dialogue query generation information retrieval natural language programming 342 360 369 374 379 ca780701 dh february 8 1979 426 pm

dynamic verification of operating system decisions dynamic verification of a decision implies that every time the decision is made there is a consistency check performed on the decision using independent hardware and software the dynamic verification of operating system decisions is used on the prime system being designed and constructed at the university of california berkeley prime is an experimental time sharing which is to have the properties of continuous availability data privacy and cost effectiveness the technique of dynamic verification allows the construction of an operating system which does not make certain decisions improperly even in the presence of a single hardware or software fault furthermore multiple faults lead to unreliable operation only if the faults happen to reinforce each other on prime dynamic verification is used to ensure that one users information cannot become available to another user gratuitously even in the presence of a single hardware or software faultthe amount of additional hardware and software required for dynamic verification can be modest cacm november 1973 fabry r s operating systems data security fault tolerance software reliability data privacy program verification modular computer systems 432 ca731102 jb january 20 1978 1056 am

multilevel operating systems the basic software for all newer computers is built on the well established need for standard operating systems this implies that all applications no matter how large complex or time consuming must operate under or more precisely on top of the standard system large applications require supervisory monitors which handle problems similar to those of the operating systems but at a different level sometimes still a third or even a fourth such level is required or desirable this leads naturally to the concept of multilevel systems similar vertically but different horizontally proper division of responsibility between levels leads to greater efficiency and less logical complexity while actually enhancing capability cacm march 1966 orchard hays w ca660310 jb march 3 1978 131 pm

amesplot a higher level data plotting software system amesplot is an extensible software system designed to make the display of data as simple painless and neat as possible the system described is hardware independent and has been implemented on a variety of installations of different manufacturers having diverse configurations the elements common to all types of data plots are outlined and the way in which these elements may be combined into a system based on simple modules is demonstrated these modules are specified independently and are independent of the axis systems or other attributes of the plot this enables plots of any complexity to be constructed by adding or replacing modules the basic syntax of amesplot is outlined and a brief description is given of its current utility software consisting of macros to produce self scaled plots formal tablets of text interspersed with subplots map coastlines and 3 d plots the system was formulate d in a way such that the user could supply the minimum of information and it should be fully integrable with users program written in most conventional higher languages the functions of positioning locating and scaling in the layout of multiple subplots of axes labels and all other elements of the plot are handled automatically by the software system unless the user specifies otherwise the structuring of plots from multiple independent self contained subplots is described transformation projection scaling rotation or shifting of entire plots or subplots by the action of one or more simple modules is possible the user may interact freely with amesplot at three levels enabling him to construct his own data markers alphabetic characters and transformations and to produce a variety of artistic and other effects cacm september 1970 hirschsoln i computer graphics data potting data display syntax hardware independent software display device independent software plot elements self scaled plots user interaction tablet organization map display projection 413 429 449 49 ca700903 jb february 10 1978 208 pm

counting large numbers of events in small registers it is possible to use a small counter to keep approximate counts of large numbers the resulting expected error can be rather precisely controlled an example is given in which 8 bit counters bytes are used to keep track of as many as 130 000 events with a relative error which is substantially independent of the number n of events this relative error can be expected to be 24 percent or less 95 percent of the time ieo n8 the techniques could be used to advantage in multichannel counting hardware or software used for the monitoring of experiments or processes cacm october 1978 morris r counting 511 ca781005 dh january 29 1979 552 pm

a stochastic evaluation model for database organization in data retrieval systems experimental work in the valuation of large scale data retrieval systems has been scarce due to its difficulty and prohibitive cost this paper discusses a simulation model of a data retrieval system which has the effect of significantly reducing the cost of experimentation and enabling research never attempted before the model is designed to estimate the retrieval workload of alternative data retrieval systems these data retrieval systems can be organized under several database organizations including inverted list threaded list and cellular list organizations and hybrid combinations of these systems effectiveness of the methodology is demonstrated by using the model to study the effect of database organizations in data retrieval systems in particular the impact of query complexity is analyzed cacm february 1976 siler k f database architecture database performance and evaluation invented list threaded list cellular list information retrieval database organizations query complexity stochastic model monte carlo simulation 370 371 372 373 374 379 ca760205 jb january 5 1978 920 am
